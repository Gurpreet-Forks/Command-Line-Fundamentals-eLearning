Tsuga diversifolia, commonly known as the northern Japanese hemlock, or in
Japanese, kometsuga (??), is a species of conifer native to the Japanese
islands of Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. In Europe and North America, the
species is sometimes employed as tree for the garden and has been in
cultivation since 1861.

## Description[edit]

Tsuga diversifolia is an evergreen tree that attains heights of 25 m (80
feet). The crown is narrow, dense and conical. Young shoots are short, palely
pubescent and bright orange to red-brown in colour. The densely arranged
needles are linear-oblong and 5 to 15 mm long and up to 2.4 mm wide. They are
a dark green in colour, glossy and furrowed above with two chalk white
stomatal bands below.[2]

The bark is an orange-brown in colour, shallowly fissured and vertically
peeling. The buds are a deep purple red. The dull purple, ovoid pistillate
flowers are terminal on either long or short shoots. They measure about 5 mm
and as they mature become pale green with the centre and margin of each scale
being purple. The cones are 1.8 to 2.8 cm long, cylindric-ovoid, and nearly
sessile. They are dark brown, pendulous and the scales are slightly convex and
ridged.[3]
