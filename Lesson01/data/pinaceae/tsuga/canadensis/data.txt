## Description[edit]

Illustrated flora of the northern states and Canada

The eastern hemlock grows well in shade and is very long lived, with the
oldest recorded specimen, found in Tionesta, Pennsylvania, being at least 554
years old.[5] The tree generally reaches heights of about 31 m (102 ft),[4]
but exceptional trees have been recorded up to 53 m (174 ft).[6] The diameter
of the trunk at breast height is often 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in), but again,
outstanding trees have been recorded up to 1.75 m (5 ft 9 in).[7] The trunk is
usually straight and monopodial, but very rarely is forked.[8] The crown is
broadly conic, while the brownish bark is scaly and deeply fissured,
especially with age.[4] The twigs are a yellow-brown in color with darker red-
brown pulvini, and are densely pubescent. The buds are ovoid in shape and are
very small, measuring only 1.5 to 2.5 mm (0 to 1/8 in) in length. These are
usually not resinous, but may be slightly so.[4][8]

The leaves are typically 15 to 20 mm (0.59 to 0.79 in) in length, but may be
as short as 5 mm (0.20 in) or as long as 25 mm (1 in). They are flattened and
are typically distichous, or two-ranked. The bottom of the leaf is glaucous
with two broad and clearly visible stomatal bands, while the top is a shiny
green to yellow-green in color. The leaf margins are very slightly toothed,
especially near the apex. The seed cones are ovoid in shape and typically
measure 1.5 to 2.5 cm (5/8 to 1 in) in length and 1.0 to 1.5 cm (3/8 to 5/8
in) in width. The scales are ovate to cuneate in shape and measure 8 to 12 mm
(3/8 to 1/2 in) in length by 7.0 to 10 mm (1/4 to 3/8 in) in width. The apex
is more or less rounded and is often projected outward. Twenty-four diploid
chromosomes are present within the trees' DNA.[4][8]

## Wood[edit]

The wood is soft, coarse-grained, and light buff in color. Air-dried, a cubic
foot weighs 28 lbs. The lumber is used for general construction and crates.
Because of its unusual power of holding spikes, it is also used for railroad
ties. Untreated, the wood is not durable if exposed to the elements. As a
fuel, it is low in value. The wood is also a source of pulp for paper
manufacturing.[9]

## Distribution and habitat[edit]

T. canadensis occurs at sea level in the north of its distribution,[8] but is
found primarily at elevations of 600-1,800 m (2,000-5,900 ft). It ranges from
northeastern Minnesota eastward through southern Quebec and into Nova Scotia,
and south in the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia and Alabama.[4][10]
Disjunct populations occur in the southeastern Piedmont, western Ohio and into
Illinois, as well as eastern Minnesota.[8][11] In Canada, it is present in
Ontario and all provinces to the east except Newfoundland and Labrador. In the
USA, it is found in all states east of and including Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama, but excluding Florida.[4] Its range
completely overlaps that of the closely related Tsuga caroliniana.[12]

It is found primarily on rocky ridges, ravines, and hillsides with relatively
high levels of moisture.[4]

### Climate[edit]

Eastern hemlock is generally confined to areas with cool and humid climates.
Precipitation in the areas where it grows is typically 740 mm (29 in) to more
than 1,270 mm (50 in) per year. The lower number is more typical of northern
forests that receive heavy snowfall; the higher number is common in southerly
areas with high summer rainfall. Near the Atlantic coast and in the southern
Appalachians where the trees often reach their greatest heights, annual
rainfall often exceeds 1,520 mm (60 in). In the north of its range, the
temperatures in January average -12 ?C (10 ?F), while in July they average
only 16 ?C (61 ?F). In these areas, the frost-free season can last fewer than
80 days. In contrast, the southern end of the range experiences up to 200 days
without frost and January temperatures as high as 6 ?C (43 ?F).[12]

## Hemlock woolly adelgid[edit]

Shoot infested with hemlock woolly adelgid

The species is currently threatened by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges
tsugae), a sap-sucking bug accidentally introduced from East Asia to the
United States in 1924, and first found in the native range of eastern hemlock
in the late 1960s.[13] The adelgid has spread very rapidly in southern parts
of the range once becoming established, while its expansion northward is much
slower.[citation needed] Virtually all the hemlocks in the southern
Appalachian Mountains have seen infestations of the insect within the last
five to seven years, with thousands of hectares of stands dying within the
last two to three years.[citation needed] Attempts to save representative
examples on both public and private lands are on-going. A project named "Tsuga
Search", funded by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, is being conducted
to save the largest and tallest remaining eastern hemlocks in the Park.
Through Tsuga Search, hemlocks have been found with trunk volumes up to 44.8
m3 within the park,[14] making it the largest eastern evergreen conifer,
eclipsing in volume both eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) and loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda). The tree is currently listed as a least concern species in the
IUCN Red List, but this is based largely on its wide distribution and because
the adelgid populations have not reached the northern areas of its range.[15]

A 2009 study conducted by scientists with the U.S. Forest Service Southern
Research Station suggests the hemlock woolly adelgid is killing hemlock trees
faster than expected in the southern Appalachians, and rapidly altering the
carbon cycle of these forests. According to Science Daily, the pest could kill
most of the region's hemlock trees within the next decade. According to the
study, researchers found "hemlock woolly adelgid infestation is rapidly
impacting the carbon cycle in [hemlock] tree stands," and "adelgid-infested
hemlock trees in the South are declining much faster than the reported 9-year
decline of some infested hemlock trees in the Northeast."[16]

Closeup of bark

In a 2009 case study, entomologists from the U.S. Forest Service, Cornell
University, and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst released 900
Laricobius nigrinus beetles into a stand of adelgid-infested hemlocks near
Lansing, New York. L. nigrinus, which is native to the Pacific Northwest,
naturally preys on the hemlock wooly adelgid. The particular site near Lansing
was chosen because its hemlocks are only lightly infested with the woolly
adelgid, and enough trees are found to sustain a long-term study. The site
will be left untreated with pesticides for 10 years to study how well the L.
nigrinus beetles become established; if the experiment proves successful,
researchers expect the population will take two to three years to build to
levels where they can be readily detected.[17]

## Ecology[edit]

The tree can be found living in association with many forest mushrooms, such
as Ramaria flavosaponaria.[18]

## Paleoecology[edit]

The mid-Holocene decline of hemlock populations is a much-studied
phenomenon.[19] From its foundation in the early Holocene (around 16,000 BP)
in what is now the southeastern US, T. canadensis expanded rapidly and
successfully into its potential range.[20] However, palynological analyses
show the hemlock population experienced a pronounced decline approximately
5,500 BP that lasted for about 1,000 years. Continued research points to
other, though less dramatic, dips in Holocene hemlock populations.[19][21]
Pathogens, insects, and climatic change, and a combination of these, have all
been proposed to explain these anomalies. The eastern hemlock increased again
after the major decline, but did not recover its former place as a dominant
species.

## Exceptional trees[edit]

Due to its being a long-lived tree, several very large or otherwise impressive
trees exist along the east coast of North America. One organization, the
Eastern Native Tree Society (ENTS), has been particularly active in
discovering and measuring these trees. In the southern Appalachians, many
individuals reach 45 metres (148 ft) tall, and one tree has been measured in
the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to 52.8 m (173 ft 3 in) tall, though
this tree is now dead from hemlock woolly adelgids; the tallest now surviving,
the "Noland Mountain tree", is 51.8 m (169 ft 11 in) tall.[14] Altogether,
ENTS has confirmed four trees to heights of 51 m (167 ft) or more by climb and
tape drop. In the Northeast, the tallest accurately measured tree is 44 m (144
ft). This tree, named the Seneca hemlock, grows in Cook Forest State Park, PA.
Above 43?N latitude, the maximum height of the species is less, under 39 m
(128 ft). In New England, ENTS has measured hemlocks to 42 m (138 ft),
although trees above 39 m are extremely rare in New England. By 44?N, the
maximum height is probably not more than 35 m (115 ft). Diameters of mature
hemlocks range from 0.75-1.8 m (2 ft 6 in-5 ft 11 in), with trees over 1.6 m
(5 ft 3 in) in diameter being very rare. In New England, the maximum diameter
is 1.4 m (4 ft 7 in).

Trunk volume is the third dimension to receive attention by ENTS. Many eastern
hemlocks have been modeled to over 30 m3 trunk volume, and the largest has
been calculated to be 44.8 m3,[14] making it the largest natural evergreen
conifer in the eastern United States. The center of maximum size development
for the species is the southern Appalachians, especially the Great Smoky
Mountains.

## Cultivation[edit]

Tsuga canadensis has long been a popular tree in cultivation. The tree's
preference for partial shade and tolerance of full shade allows it to be
planted in areas where other conifers would not easily grow. In addition, its
very fine-textured foliage that droops to the ground, its pyramidal growth
habit, and its ability to withstand hard pruning make it a desirable
ornamental tree. In cultivation, it prefers sites that are slightly acidic to
neutral with nutrient-rich and moist but well-drained soil. It is most often
used as a specimen, for a screen, or in small group plantings, though it can
also be trained as a dense formal hedge. It should not be used on roadsides
where salt is used in winter, as its foliage is sensitive to salt spray. It is
also poorly adapted as a windbreak tree, as wind exposure causes dieback in
winter. It has several drawbacks, such as a fairly low tolerance of urban
stress, intolerance for very wet or very dry soils, and susceptibility to
attack by the hemlock woolly adelgid, though this is treatable.[22] Its
tendency to shed needles rapidly after being cut down renders it unsuitable as
a Christmas tree.

It was introduced to British gardens in 1736.[23] In the UK, it is encountered
frequently in gardens both large and small, as well as some parks, and is most
common in the eastern areas of the country. It is sometimes employed as a
hedge, but is considered inferior for this usage compared to Tsuga
heterophylla (western hemlock); it is not well adapted to the UK climate and
as a consequence often has a poorly developed, forked and sinuous trunk
there.[23][24] In Germany, it is the most frequently seen hemlock in
cultivation, and is also used in forestry.[25]

### Cultivars[edit]

The weeping shrub form T. canadensis 'Sargentii'

Over 300 cultivars have been selected for use, many of them being dwarf forms
and shrubs. A partial list of popular cultivars includes:[22][26]

  * 'Beehive' - a very small dwarf shrub typically growing to 1 m high and 1.5 m wide, resembling a spreading beehive in form
  * 'Bennett' - a dwarf shrub reaching 1 m high and 1.5 m wide, with upper branchlets that first ascend and then arch upper, this selection prefers partial shade.
  * 'Cole's Prostrate' - a groundcover form that can also be used in bonsai as an alternative to the prostrate junipers, it slowly grows to only 30 cm tall with a 1.3-m spread, with the central stems eventually becoming visible. It also prefers partial shade.
  * 'Gentsch White' - a dwarf shrub growing to 1.3 m tall with an equal spread and new spring growth that turns creamy-white in autumn through winter, creating a dramatic contrast with the dark green old growth, it is easily scorched by the sun and requires partial shade. It is recommend to feather shear annually to keep it compact and create more tip growth.
  * 'Jeddeloh' - a dwarf shrub reaching to 1 m high and 1.5 m wide, showing a small concavity in the centre, it is an alternative to the bird's-nest spruce (Picea abies 'Nidiformis'). This cultivar has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[27]
  * 'Pendula' - an upright weeping form whose height is dependent on how long it is staked, but is typically seen 0.6-1.5 m tall with a 1.5-m spread
  * 'Sargentii' - a popular large weeping shrub that grows to 3 m tall with a wide spread up to 6 m, it features numerous pendulous branches and is most effectively employed near water, in rock gardens, or on embankments.
