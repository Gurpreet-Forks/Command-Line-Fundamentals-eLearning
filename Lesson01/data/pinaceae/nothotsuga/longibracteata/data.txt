## Description[edit]

N. longibracteata is an evergreen tree reaching 30 m (100 ft) tall. The leaves
are flat, needle-like, 1.2-4 cm (0.5-1.6 in) long and 1-2 mm (0.04-0.08 in)
broad, very similar to those of Tsuga. The cones are very similar to those of
Keteleeria, but smaller, 2.5-5 cm (1-2 in) long, erect, and mature in about
6-8 months after pollination.

### Taxonomy[edit]

In many respects, Nothotsuga is intermediate between the genera Keteleeria and
Tsuga. It was discovered in 1932, and at first treated as Tsuga
longibracteata, being classified in its own genus in 1989 when new research
indicated how distinct it is from other species of Tsuga \- by the larger,
erect cones with exserted bracts, and (like Keteleeria) male cones in umbels,
and from Keteleeria by the shorter leaves and smaller cones.

## Conservation[edit]

It is a very rare tree listed as a near-threatened species by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature due to historical
deforestation, though it is now protected.[1]
