Pinus nelsonii, Nelson's pinyon, is a species of pine native to the mountains
of northeastern Mexico, in Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas at
1,800-3,200 m altitude. It has very singular characteristics and is not
closely related to any other pines in either morphology[2][3][4] or
genetics.[5][6] It is placed in subgenus Strobus either in its own section
Nelsonia[3] or subsection Nelsoniae.[5]

    

> "Pinus nelsonii is exceptional. Evidence from three nuclear genes (Syring et
al., 2005) and cpDNA (Gernandt et al., 2005) resolve P. nelsonii as sister
lineage to the remaining members of sect. Parrya. In contrast, the LEA-like
locus used in this study places P. nelsonii in a unique, moderately supported
(71% BS) position sister to sect. Quinquefoliae when midpoint rooting is
employed."[6]

It is a small tree growing to 10 m tall with a trunk up to 20-30 cm diameter.
The crown is rounded and dense, and resembles that of the unrelated Pinus
pinea from the western Mediterranean. The needles are produced in fascicles of
three (occasionally four), but 'zipped' together by their finely serrated
margins so that they look like a single needle; they can only be separated by
force.[7][8] They are 4-8 (rarely 10) cm long and 0.7-1 mm thick, sub-shiny
dark green in colour, with a persistent grey basal sheath 7-9 mm long. The
cones are cylindrical, 6-12 cm long and 4-5 cm broad, orange-brown to red-
brown colour, with 60-100 scales with large but indistinct umbos, and carried
on a stout downcurved peduncle 3-6 cm long. Unlike all other pines, their
growth while immature does not pause during the first winter. The seeds are
large, 12-15 mm, red-brown. The cones mature in November after rain season. It
grows in a semi-arid temperate climate with summer rainfall and is very
drought-tolerant.[4][9]

The seeds are edible and delicious and are very appreciated by people in the
region and are so valuable that they are transported to the markets of Mexico
City. Because of its seeds it has been very devastated by people.[citation
needed] Only recently it has been cultivated outside its native range, grown
more for its botanical curiosity than for ornamental values.[4]

The scientific name is occasionally cited incorrectly as Pinus nelsoni; the
correct ending is -ii.[9]
