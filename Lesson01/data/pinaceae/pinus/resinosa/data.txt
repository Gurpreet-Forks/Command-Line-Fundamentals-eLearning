Pinus resinosa, known as red pine[1][2] or Norway pine, is a pine native to
North America. It occurs from Newfoundland west to Manitoba, and south to
Pennsylvania, with several smaller, disjunct populations occurring in the
Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and West Virginia, as well as a few small
pockets in extreme northern New Jersey and northern Illinois.[3][4]

## Description[edit]

Red pine is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by tall, straight growth
in a variety of habitats.[5] It usually ranges from 20-35 m (66-115 ft) in
height and 1 m (3 ft 3 in) in trunk diameter, exceptionally reaching 43.77 m
(143 ft 7 in) tall.[6] The crown is conical, becoming a narrow rounded dome
with age. The bark is thick and gray-brown at the base of the tree, but thin,
flaky and bright orange-red in the upper crown; the tree's name derives from
this distinctive character. Some red color may be seen in the fissures of the
bark. The species is self pruning; there tend not to be dead branches on the
trees, and older trees may have very long lengths of branchless trunk below
the canopy.

The leaves are needle-like, dark yellow-green, in fascicles of two,[5] 12-18
cm (4 3/4-7 in) long, and brittle. The leaves snap cleanly when bent; this
character, stated as diagnostic for red pine in some texts, is however shared
by several other pine species. The cones are symmetrical ovoid, 4-6 cm (1
1/2-2 1/4 in) long by 2.5 cm (1 in) broad, and purple before maturity,
ripening to nut-blue and opening to 4-5 cm (1 1/2-2 in) broad, the scales
without a prickle and almost stalkless.[1]

Red pine is notable for its very constant morphology and low genetic variation
throughout its range, suggesting it has been through a near extinction in its
recent evolutionary history.[7][8] A genetic study of nuclear microsatellite
polymorphisms among populations distributed throughout its natural range found
that red pine populations from Newfoundland are genetically distinct from most
mainland populations, consistent with dispersal from different glacial refugia
in this highly self-pollinating species.[9]

## Ecology[edit]

It is intolerant of shade, but does well in windy sites; it grows best in
well-drained soil. It is a long-lived tree, reaching a maximum age of about
500 years.[10] The wood is commercially valuable in forestry for timber and
paper pulp, and the tree is also used for landscaping.

## Culture[edit]

The red pine is the state tree of Minnesota.[11]

  * Tree roots anchor the structure and provide water and nutrients. The ground has eroded away around the roots of this young red pine tree.
