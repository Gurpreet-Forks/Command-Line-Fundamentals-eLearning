Pinus dalatensis, also known as Vietnamese white pine or Dalat pine,[1] is a
species of pine endemic to Indochina. In Vietnam it grows in the mountains of
the central and south-central parts of the country at elevations of 1,400 to
2,300 metres (4,600 to 7,500 ft).[3][4] Only recently confirmed from Laos, the
population located within the Nakai-Nam Theun Biodiversity Conservation Area
is the largest, at the lowest elevation, and the northernmost of the known
populations of P. dalatensis.[5]

## Description[edit]

Pinus dalatensis is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 30 to 40 metres
(98 to 131 ft) tall. It is a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus
Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in
fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The needles are finely
serrated, and (3-)5-14 cm long.

The cones are slender, 6 to 23 centimetres (2.4 to 9.1 in) long and 2 to 4
centimetres (0.79 to 1.57 in) broad (closed), opening to 3 to 9 centimetres
(1.2 to 3.5 in) broad; the scales are thin and flexible. The seeds are small,
6 to 8 millimetres (0.24 to 0.31 in) long, and have a long slender wing 18 to
25 millimetres (0.71 to 0.98 in) long. It is most closely related to the blue
pine Pinus wallichiana from the Himalaya.[3][4]

### Subspecies[edit]

It is divided into two subspecies:[3]

  * Pinus dalatensis subsp. dalatensis. Da Lat region, between 11?50'N and 12?30'N. Cones 6-17 cm long.
  * Pinus dalatensis subsp. procera Businsky. Central Vietnam, between 15?00'N and 16?20'N. Cones 13-23 cm long.
