Natural range of Pinus montezumae  
  
Pinus montezumae, known as the Montezuma pine, is a species of conifer in the
family Pinaceae. It is native to Mexico and Central America, where it is known
as ocote. The tree grows about 35 m high and 80 cm in diameter; occasionally
it may reach a height of 40 m and diameter of 1 m. It has a round crown. The
bark is dark brown-grayish.

It is found from the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon (25? N). Lat. and Jalisco
(22?) to the north and to Nicaragua (15? S. Lat.) to the south. It occurs on
both mountain ranges of the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental.
It grows at altitudes from 2000-3200 m above sea level. It is found in areas
between 800-1000 mm rainfall per year. In most of the tree's habitat, rain
falls mostly in summer, but in the state of Veracruz, precipitations are
spread year round and the climate is very wet. However, specimens from the
state of Jalisco grow in semi-arid places. It occurs in warm temperate to cool
climates (18 ?C to 10 ?C). At the highest altitudes of its distribution it
usually receives snow in the winter.

Tree

Ocote wood is yellowish-brown white, with the heartwood being light brown, is
hard, heavy and used for construction. It is appreciated for its resin. The
resin is so flammable that a cut branch will burn as a torch emitting black
smoke when ignited; for this reason, it is very common in Mexico to use ocote
wood as a fire starter for campfires and barbecues. First 3 to 6 years growth
is slow, after this stage it is a fast-growing tree. The cities of Ocotlan in
Jalisco Mexico and Ocotal in Nicaragua derive their names from this tree.
Planted commercially: in South Africa and Queensland, Australia at mid
altitudes. Kenya, Malawi, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Bolivia at high altitudes.
Trees planted in New Zealand and New South Wales, Australia near sea level
have done very well.
