## Distribution[edit]

The tree is found in two separate locations, one across central peninsular
Florida, and the other in the western Florida panhandle in the Alabama coast.
There is a range gap of about 200 km (120 mi) between the populations (from
Apalachicola to Cedar Key).

It is largely confined to very infertile, excessively well-drained, sandy
habitats where competition from larger-growing species is minimized by the
harsh growing conditions of hot sun, fast draining white sands, and frequent
severe seasonal droughts. It is often the only canopy tree in the Florida
scrub ecosystem.

## Description[edit]

Pinus clausa is a small, often shrubby tree from 5-10 m (16-33 ft),
exceptionally to 21 m (69 ft) tall.

The leaves are needle-like, in pairs, 5-10 cm (2.0-3.9 in) long, and its cones
are 3-8 cm (1.2-3.1 in) long.[3]

Over much of its range, it is fire-adapted to stand-replacing wildfires, with
the cones remaining closed for many years (clausa = closed), until a natural
forest fire kills the mature trees and opens the cones. These then reseed the
burnt ground. Some populations differ in having cones that open at maturity,
with seed dispersal not relying on fires.[4]

## Uses[edit]

Pinus clausa woodlands are an important part of the Florida scrub ecosystem,
and provide habitat for the endangered Florida Sand Skink, among other
species. It is one of the few canopy trees able to grow in arid, sandy, and
hot locations with minimal care.

While the dense branching makes this tree unsuitable for wood production, it
is often used for wood pulp.
