Pinus koraiensis is a species of pine known commonly as the Korean pine. It is
native to eastern Asia: Korea, northeastern China, Mongolia, the temperate
rainforests of the Russian Far East, and central Japan. In the north of its
range, it grows at moderate altitudes, typically 600 metres (2,000 ft) to 900
metres (3,000 ft), whereas further south, it is a mountain tree, growing at
2,000 metres (6,600 ft) to 2,600 metres (8,500 ft) altitude in Japan.[1] Other
common names include Chinese pinenut.[2]

## Description[edit]

It is a member of the white pine group, Pinus, section Quinquefoliae. In its
native habitat and growing conditions it can reach 100 feet (30 m) in height.
Cultivated specimens may grow up to 50 feet (15 m) tall.[3] It is pyramidal in
shape, younger specimens with ascending branches and older trees with more
horizontal branches that reach ground level. The gray or brownish bark flakes
off to reveal reddish inner bark. Its branches are lined with bundles of five
blue-green needles each up to 4.5 inches (11 3/8 cm) and bear brown cones up
to 6 inches (15 cm) long.[3]

## Uses and conservation[edit]

The nuts of this tree are edible and sold commercially.[3] It is the most
common taxon sold as pine nuts in markets throughout Europe and the United
States.[1] The nut oil contains 11.5% of the unusual fatty acid pinolenic acid
(cis-5-cis-9-cis-12 octadecatrienoic acid).[4] The oil is used to make
lubricants and soap.[5] The tree is also a source of turpentine resin and
tannin.[1][6]

The Korean pine is used as an ornamental tree. It is tolerant of several soil
types and thrives in urban settings. It is adapted to climates with very cold
winters.[3] There are several cultivars, including the blue-tinged 'Glauca'
and 'Silveray' and the wide-bodied 'Winton'.[7]

The wood is versatile and very useful for construction.[3] It is light, with
straight grains, and easy to work. It is used for a great variety of products,
including telephone poles, railroad ties, bridges, boats, plywood and
flooring, furniture, sports equipment, and musical instruments. It is easy to
break down into chips, particle board, or pulp for paper.[1] Its value has led
to overexploitation of wild populations of the tree, and destruction of the
forest ecosystems in which it grows. The Siberian tiger is resident in these
pine forests, and preservation of this tree species is one step in the
conservation of the tiger.[1]

Other associates of the tree in nature include the spotted nutcracker
(Nucifraga caryocatactes), which collects the seeds and plays an important
role in their dispersal.[8]
