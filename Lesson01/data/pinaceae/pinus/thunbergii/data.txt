## Description[edit]

Black pines can reach the height of 40 m, but rarely achieves this size
outside its natural range. The needles are in fascicles of two with a white
sheath at the base, 7-12 cm long; female cones are 4-7 cm in length, scaled,
with small points on the tips of the scales, taking two years to mature. Male
cones are 1-2 cm long borne in clumps of 12-20 on the tips of the spring
growth. Bark is gray on young trees and small branches, changing to black and
plated on larger branches and the trunk; becoming quite thick on older trunks.

## Ecology[edit]

In North America this tree is subject to widespread mortality by the native
American pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, spread by means of
beetle vectors. Subsequently, blue stain fungus invades the plant, leading to
a rapid decline and death. This nematode has also been introduced to Japan
accidentally, leading to the species becoming endangered in its native area.

## Uses[edit]

Because of its resistance to pollution and salt, it is a popular horticultural
tree. In Japan it is widely used as a garden tree both trained as Niwaki and
untrained growing as an overstory tree. The trunks and branches are trained
from a young age to be elegant and interesting to view. It is one of the
classic bonsai subjects, requiring great patience over many years to train
properly.
