Pinus echinata, the shortleaf pine,[2] is a species of pine native to the
eastern United States from southernmost New York State, south to northern
Florida, west to eastern Oklahoma, and southwest to eastern Texas. The tree is
variable in form, sometimes straight, sometimes crooked, with an irregular
crown. This tree reaches heights of 20-30 metres (65-100 ft) with a trunk
diameter of 0.5-0.9 metres (1 ft 8 in-2 ft 11 in).

The leaves are needle-like, in fascicles (bundles) of two and three mixed
together, and from 7-11 cm (2 3/4-4 1/4 in) long. The cones are 4-7 cm (1
1/2-2 3/4 in) long, with thin scales with a transverse keel and a short
prickle. They open at maturity but are persistent.[3] Shortleaf pine seedlings
develop a persistent J-shaped crook near the ground surface.[4] Axillary and
other buds form near the crook and initiate growth if the upper stem is killed
by fire or is severed.

This pine is a source of wood pulp, plywood veneer, and lumber for a variety
of uses. The shortleaf pine is one of the southern US "southern yellow pines;
it is also occasionally called southern yellow pine or the shortstraw pine.
Shortleaf pine has the largest range of the southern US yellow pines.

This pine occupies a variety of habitats from rocky uplands to wet flood
plains. It frequently hybridizes naturally with loblolly pine and pitch pine
where their ranges intersect.
