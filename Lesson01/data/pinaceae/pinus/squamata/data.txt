Pinus squamata, the Qiaojia pine (zh: ?????) or southern lacebark pine,[2] is
a critically endangered[1] pine native to a single locality consisting of
about 20 trees in Qiaojia County, northeast Yunnan, China, at about 2,200 m
(7,200 ft) elevation.

The Qiaojia pine was discovered in April 1991 by Pangzhao J.Q. It was studied
later that year and described the following year by Li Xiang-Wang. It shows
similarities to Rzedowski's Pinyon and some other pinyon pines.

## Description[edit]

Its mature height is unknown because none of the living trees are yet mature,
but they could possibly grow to 30 m (98 ft) or greater. Its habitat is open
secondary woodland, scrub, and grassland mixed with Yunnan pine.

The Qiaojia pine has a conic crown with flaky pale gray-green bark becoming
dark brown with age, similar to the closely related Lacebark pine. The shoots
are reddish to greenish brown and may be pubescent or glabrous. The leaves are
drooping in fascicles of 4 or 5, 9-17 cm (3.5-6.7 in) long by 0.8 mm (0.031
in) wide, glossy green above with white stomatal bands on the underside.

The cones are conic to ovoid, reddish brown, and 9 cm (3.5 in) long by 6 cm
(2.4 in) broad when open. They open at maturity in September to October of the
second year to release the oblong black seeds, 4-5 mm (0.16-0.20 in) long with
a 16 mm (0.63 in) wing.[3]

## Conservation[edit]

Pinus squamata is the rarest of world pine species, with the endangered Torrey
pine, Pinus torreyana, being the next most rare pine species.[4]
