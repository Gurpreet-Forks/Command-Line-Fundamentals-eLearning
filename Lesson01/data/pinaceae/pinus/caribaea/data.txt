The Caribbean pine, Pinus caribaea, is a hard pine, native to Central America,
Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It belongs to Australes
Subsection in Pinus Subgenus. It inhabits tropical and subtropical coniferous
forests, which include both lowland savannas and montane forests. Wildfire
plays a major role limiting the range of this species, but it has been
reported that this tree regenerates quickly and aggressively, replacing
latifoliate trees.[1] In zones not subject to periodic fires, the succession
continues and a tropical forest thrives.

It has been widely cultivated outside its natural range, and introduced
populations can be found nowadays in Jamaica, Colombia, South Africa, Sri
Lanka, Fiji and China.

## Varieties[edit]

The species has three accepted varieties:[2]

  * Pinus caribaea var. caribaea (Pinar del Rio Province and Isla de la Juventud in western Cuba)
  * Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis (Grisebach) W.H.Barrett & Golfari - Bahamas pine (The Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands)
  * Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis (Seneclauze) W.H.Barrett & Golfari - Honduras pine (state of Quintana Roo in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua)

## Colonization of the Caribbean basin[edit]

It has been proposed that the pines of Australes subsection (of which
Caribbean pine is part) arrived to the Caribbean basin from Southeastern
USA.[3] Recently, paleoclimatic[4] and genetic data[5] have been used to
propose that Pinus caribaea would have originated in Central America.
According to chloroplast genetic data, Pinus caribaea lineages colonized the
Caribbean islands from populations in Central America at least twice (one
leading to Cuban populations and another leading to Bahamaninan
populations).[5] Moreover, pine populations in the Caribbean basin appear to
have been larger during the maximum glacial periods, due to the increase in
both emerged land and dry conditions.

## Conservation[edit]

While the species as a whole is not threatened, the typical variety of Cuba
has markedly declined due to deforestation and is now considered a vulnerable
species by the IUCN.[6] Populations in Bahamas and Turks & Caicos Islands
would be particularly vulnerable in a global warming scenario due to the
increase in sea level and consequent reduction in the emerged land area.
