## Description[edit]

It is an evergreen tree reaching 25-45 metres (82-148 ft) in height, with a
broad, rounded crown of long branches. The bark is thick, greyish-brown, and
scaly plated at the base of the trunk, and orange-red, thin, and flaking
higher on the trunk. The leaves are needle-like, dark green, with two per
fascicle, 12-20 centimetres (4.7-7.9 in) long and 0.8-1 millimetre
(0.031-0.039 in) wide, the persistent fascicle sheath 1.5-2 centimetres
(0.59-0.79 in) long. The cones are ovoid, 4-7 centimetres (1.6-2.8 in) long,
chestnut-brown, opening when mature in late winter to 4-6 centimetres (1.6-2.4
in) broad. The seeds are winged, 4-6 millimetres (0.16-0.24 in) long with a
10-15 millimetres (0.39-0.59 in) wing. Pollination is in mid spring, with the
cones maturing 18-20 months after.[2][3][4]

## Ecology[edit]

In the 1970s and 80s, the Pinewood nematode from North America and pine-needle
scale insect from Taiwan, together virtually eliminated the native Pinus
massoniana in Hong Kong.[5]

## Uses[edit]

The species is a common trees in plantation forestry for replacing or
compensating of the loss of the natural forest in southern China.[6] Chinese
rosin is obtained mainly from the turpentine of this pine (Pinus massoniana)
and slash pine (P. elliottii).

Logs are mainly used to make pulp for paper industry.

Leaves are used to give special smoke flavor to a local black tea, such as
Lapsang souchong of Fujian province.
