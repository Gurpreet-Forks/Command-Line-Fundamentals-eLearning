Pinus longaeva (commonly referred to as the Great Basin bristlecone pine,
intermountain bristlecone pine, or western bristlecone pine)[2] is a long-
living species of bristlecone pine tree found in the higher mountains of
California, Nevada, and Utah.[3] One member of this species, at 5,067 years
old, is the oldest known living non-clonal organism on Earth.[4] In 1987, the
bristlecone pine was designated one of Nevada's state trees.[5]

## Physical characteristics[edit]

It is a medium-size tree, reaching 5 to 15 m (16 to 49 ft) tall and with a
trunk diameter of up to 2.5 to 3.6 m (8 to 12 ft). The bark is bright orange-
yellow, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The needles are in fascicles
of five, stout, 2.5 to 4 cm (1 to 1 1/2 in) long, deep green to blue-green on
the outer face, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner
surfaces. The leaves show the longest persistence of any plant, with some
remaining green for 45 years (Ewers & Schmid 1981).

These ancient trees have a gnarled and stunted appearance, especially those
found at high altitudes,[2] and have reddish-brown bark with deep fissures.[6]
As the tree ages, much of its vascular cambium layer may die. In very old
specimens, often only a narrow strip of living tissue connects the roots to a
handful of live branches.

The cones are ovoid-cylindrical, 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) long and 3 to 4 cm (1
to 1 1/2 in) broad when closed, green or purple at first, ripening orange-buff
when 16 months old, with numerous thin, fragile scales, each scale with a
bristle-like spine 2 to 5 mm (1/16 to 3/16 in) long. The cones open to 4 to 6
cm (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 in) broad when mature, releasing the seeds immediately
after opening. The seeds are 5 mm (3/16 in) long, with a 12 to 22 mm (1/2 to
7/8 in) wing; they are mostly dispersed by the wind, but some are also
dispersed by Clark's nutcrackers.

The Great Basin bristlecone pine differs from the Rocky Mountain bristlecone
pine in that the needles of the former always have two uninterrupted resin
canals, so it lacks the characteristic small white resin flecks appearing on
the needles of the latter. The Great Basin bristlecone pine differs from the
foxtail pine because the cone bristles of the former are over 2 mm (0.079 in)
long, and the cones have a more rounded (not conic) base. The green pine
needles give the twisted branches a bottle-brush appearance. The name
'bristlecone pine' refers to the dark purple female cones that bear incurved
prickles on their surface.[7]

## Distribution and ecology[edit]

The species occurs in Utah, Nevada and eastern California. In California, it
is restricted to the White Mountains, the Inyo Mountains, and the Panamint
Range, in Mono and Inyo counties. In Nevada, it is found in most of the higher
ranges of the Basin and Range from the Spring Mountains near Las Vegas north
to the Ruby Mountains, and in Utah, northeast to South Tent in the Wasatch
Range.

The tree grows in large open stands, unlike the related foxtail pine, which
sometimes form dense forests. Pinus longaeva trees generally do not form
closed canopies, usually covering only 15-50%.[1] Pinus longaeva shares
habitats with a number of other pine species, including the ponderosa pine,
the white fir and, notably, the limber pine, a similarly long-lived high-
elevation species.[2] The tree is a "vigorous" primary succession species,
growing quickly on new open ground.[2] It is a "poor competitor" in good
soils, however, and the species does best in harsh terrain. Pinus longaeva is
often the dominant species in high-elevation dolomite soils, where few plants
can grow.[2]

Bristlecone pines are protected in a number of areas owned by the United
States federal government, such as the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest in the
White Mountains of California and the Great Basin National Park in
Nevada.[7][8] These areas prohibit the cutting or gathering of wood.[8]

Clark's nutcrackers pluck P. longaeva seeds out of the opening cones. The
nutcrackers use the seeds as a food resource, storing many for later use in
the ground, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow
into new plants.

An introduced fungal disease known as white pine blister rust (Cronartium
ribicola) is believed to affect some individuals. The species was placed on
the IUCN Red List and listed as "Vulnerable", or threatened, in 1998.[9] In
2011, however, a population survey found the population of Pinus longaeva to
be stable, with no known subpopulations decreasing in size. White pine blister
rust was found to have a negligible effect on the population. As a result, the
species was moved to "Least Concern".[1]

### Fire ecology[edit]

The tree is extremely vulnerable to fire, and is damaged by even low-intensity
burns. The resinous bark is capable of igniting quickly, and a crown fire will
almost certainly kill the tree. However, populations of Pinus longaeva are
known to be extremely resilient, and as a primary succession species, it is
believed that populations of the tree would reestablish itself quickly after a
fire. That said, large-scale fires are extremely uncommon where the species
grows, and are not a major factor in the species' long-term viability.[2]

## Age[edit]

Bristlecone pine, White Mountains, California

A specimen of this species, located in the White Mountains of California was
measured by Tom Harlan, a researcher with the Laboratory of Tree-Ring
Research, to be 5,067 years old.[4] The identity of the specimen is being kept
secret by Harlan.[10] This is the oldest known non-clonal tree in the world.

The previously oldest named specimen of this species, "Methuselah", is also
located in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest of the White Mountains.
Methuselah is 4,850 years old, as measured by annual ring count on a small
core taken with an increment borer. Its exact location is also kept secret.

Among the White Mountain specimens, the oldest trees are found on north-facing
slopes, with an average of 2,000 years, as compared to the 1,000 year average
on the southern slopes.[11] The climate and the durability of their wood can
preserve them long after death, with dead trees as old as 7,000 years
persisting next to live ones.[11]
