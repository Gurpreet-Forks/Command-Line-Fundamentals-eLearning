A grove of isolated Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine

Pinus aristata, the Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine (or the Colorado
bristlecone pine[2]), is a long-living species of bristlecone pine tree native
to the United States. It appears in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and
northern New Mexico, with isolated populations in the San Francisco Peaks in
Arizona and the Kaibab National Forest north of the Grand Canyon. It is
usually found at very high altitudes, from 7,000-13,000 feet (2,100-4,000
m),[3] in cold, dry subalpine climate conditions, often at the tree line,
although it also forms extensive closed-canopy stands at somewhat lower
elevations.

## Description[edit]

Pinus aristata is a medium-size tree, reaching 2-6 m (8-20 ft) high and 3-4.5
m (10-15 ft) wide.[4] Mature trunk diameter is highly variable. The bark is
grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The leaves ('needles')
are in fascicles of five, stout, 2.5-4 cm (1-1 1/2 in) long, deep green to
blue-green on the outer face, with stomata confined to a bright white band on
the inner surfaces. The cones are ovoid-cylindrical, 5-10 cm (2-4 in) long and
3-4 cm (1-1 1/2 in) broad when closed, purple at first, ripening yellow-buff
when 16 months old, with numerous thin, fragile scales, each scale with a
bristle-like spine 4-8 mm (3/16-5/16 in) long.

The cones open to 4-6 cm (1 1/2-2 1/2 in) broad when mature, releasing the
seeds immediately after opening. The seeds are 5 mm (3/16 in) long, with a
10-20 mm (1/2-3/4 in) wing; they are mostly dispersed by the wind, but some
are also dispersed by Clark's Nutcrackers, which pluck the seeds out of the
opening cones. The nutcrackers use the seeds as a food resource, storing many
for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to
grow into new plants.

It differs most conspicuously from the two other bristlecone pine species in
that the needles usually have only one resin canal (or rarely two), and these
are commonly interrupted and broken, leading to highly characteristic small
white resin flecks appearing on the needles. This character, which looks a bit
like 'dandruff' on the needles, is diagnostic of Pinus aristata; no other pine
shows it (though sometimes, scale insect infestations can look superficially
similar).

It is a long-lived tree, though not attaining the longevity of Pinus longaeva.
The oldest known tree, which grows high on Black Mountain in Colorado, was
found to have at 2,435-year tree ring record (and overall estimated age of
2,480 years, per Craig Brunstein) in 1992.[5] However, trees rarely live over
1,500 years.

This species was previously described as a subspecies of Pinus balfouriana
(Pinus balfouriana aristata). Pinus aristata is currently regarded as one of
three closely related species known as bristlecone pines and is sometimes
named Rocky Mountains bristlecone pine or Colorado bristlecone pine. In
addition to its informal and regional names, the trees are referred to as the
foxtail pine or hickory pine.

## Cultivation[edit]

Pinus aristata is by far the most common of the bristlecone pines in
cultivation, where it is a very attractive slow-growing small tree suitable
for small gardens in cold climates. Even so, it is never as long-lived as in
the wild, typically living less than 100 years before it succumbs to root
decay in the warmer, moister conditions prevalent in most inhabited places.
