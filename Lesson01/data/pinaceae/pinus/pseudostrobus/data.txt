Pinus pseudostrobus, known in English as the smooth-bark Mexican pine and in
Spanish as chamite or pacingo, is a tree endemic to Mexico.

It is 8 to 25 m tall, dense and round top, the bark is brown and fissured and
smooth when young. It grows between 1300-3250 m. From 26? to 15? north
latitude, from Sinaloa, Mexico to El Salvador and Honduras. It occurs within a
rainfalls regime mostly in summer. A stand of about 15 fully mature Mexican
pines is in Imperial County, California, at the Palo Verde County Park, in a
narrow strip of land between Hwy 78 and the Colorado River.

It has been introduced in New Zealand near sea level and has done well.
