Pinus ayacahuite, also called ayacahuite pine[1] and Mexican white pine,[1]
(family Pinaceae) is a species of pine native to the mountains of southern
Mexico and western Central America, in the Sierra Madre del Sur and the
eastern end of the Eje Volcanico Transversal, between 14? and 21?N latitude in
the Mexican states of Guerrero, Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz and Chiapas, and in
Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. It grows on relatively moist areas with
summer rainfalls, however specimens from its eastern and southern distribution
live under really wet conditions; it needs full sun and well drained soils.
Its temperature needs fluctuate between 19 and 10 ?C on average a year. This
tree accepts from subtropical to cool climate.

Pinus ayacahuite is a large tree, regularly growing to 30-45 m and
exceptionally up to 50 m tall. It is a member of the white pine group, Pinus
subgenus Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles')
are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The needles are
finely serrated, and 9-16 cm long. The cones are long and slender, 15-40 cm
long and 4-6 cm broad (closed), opening to 6-10 cm broad; the scales are thin
and flexible. The seeds are small, 6-8 mm long, and have a long slender wing
18-25 mm long.

It is moderately susceptible to white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola),
but in cultivation has proved somewhat less susceptible than most other
American white pines (see e.g. western white pine, sugar pine).

## Cultivation and uses[edit]

It has been planted with ornamental and commercial purposes for paper industry
at different latitudes and altitudes in different parts of the world: In
Equatorial and tropical regions- Commercial production: On the high elevations
of Kenya, Tanzania and Angola. In temperate subtropical regions- Commercial
production: It is planted on the highlands of South Africa. On the highest
elevations of Southern Brazil. Northern India. In temperate regions at middle
and low altitudes: Argentine provinces of Salta, Tucuman and Cordoba; at 500
to 1500 m above sea level. At low elevations near sea level: Commercial
production: Australia (Queensland and New South Wales), New Zealand. As
ornamental: It has as been successfully planted in the British Isles. The
largest tree in Germany (height 2013: 20.5 m) is growing in the arboretum
Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen.[2]

Despite its tropical origins (the natural range is entirely south of the
Tropic of Cancer), it is surprisingly tolerant of cold, having survived
temperatures down to nearly -30 ?C in cultivation in Scotland and
Pennsylvania, United States. It is grown as an ornamental tree in parks for
its attractive foliage and very long cones, among the longest that can be
grown in many temperate areas.

The wood is valuable, used for general indoor construction work.
