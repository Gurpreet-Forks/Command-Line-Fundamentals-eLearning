Pinus balfouriana (foxtail pine) is a rare high-elevation pine that is endemic
to California, United States. It is closely related to the Great Basin and
Rocky Mountain bristlecone pines, in the subsection Balfourianae. The two
disjunct populations are found in the southern Klamath Mountains (subspecies
balfouriana) and the southern Sierra Nevada[2] (subspecies austrina). A small
outlying population was reported in southern Oregon, but was proven to have
been misidentified.[3]

## Description[edit]

A Foxtail Pine in the southern Sierra Nevada.

P. balfouriana is a tree to 10-20 m (30-70 ft) tall, exceptionally 35 m (115
ft), with a trunk up to 2 m (7 ft) across. Its leaves are needle-like, in
bundles of five (or sometimes four, in the southern Sierra) with a semi-
persistent basal sheath, and 2-4 cm (1-1 1/2 in) long, deep glossy green on
the outer face, and white on the inner faces; they persist for 10-15 years.
The cones are 6-11 cm (2 1/2-4 1/2 in) long, dark purple ripening red-brown,
with soft, flexible scales each with a 1-millimeter (1/16-inch) central
prickle.

## Distribution[edit]

P. balfouriana occurs in the subalpine forest at an elevation of 1,950-2,750 m
(6,400-9,020 ft) in the Klamath Mountains, and at 2,300-3,500 m (7,500-11,500
ft) in the Sierra Nevada. In the Sierra Nevada, Foxtail pines are limited to
the area around Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. In both areas, it is
often a tree line species.

## Age[edit]

It is thought that P. balfouriana can live up to 3000 years in the Sierra
Nevada, although the highest currently proven age is 2110 years. In the
Klamath Mountains, ages are only known to about 1000 years.

In the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness.

## Related species[edit]

P. balfouriana is closely related to the bristlecone pines, being classified
in the same subsection Balfourianae; it has been hybridised with the Great
Basin Bristlecone Pine in cultivation, though no hybrids have ever been found
in the wild.
