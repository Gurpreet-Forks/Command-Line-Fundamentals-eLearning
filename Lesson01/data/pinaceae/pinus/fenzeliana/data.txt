## Description[edit]

The Pinus fenzeliana leaves are needle-like, in fascicles of five, and 5-13 cm
long. The cones are 6-11 cm long, with thick, woody scales; the seeds are
large, about 8-15 mm long, with a vestigial 3 mm wing, similar to the related
Chinese White Pine (Pinus armandii). Hainan White Pine differs from that
species in the shorter needles, smaller cones, and in being adapted to a
subtropical rainforest habitat.

A pine from the Dabie Shan mountains in Anhui, eastern China, first described
as a species Pinus dabeshanensis, is occasionally treated as a variety of this
species, but more commonly as a variety of P. armandii, which it more closely
resembles.

Reports of Pinus fenzeliana from Vietnam have not been verified; trees in this
area have proved to be either Vietnamese White Pine (Pinus dalatensis) or
Guangdong White Pine (Pinus wangii), which both differ markedly in cone and
seed size and shape, though similar in foliage.
