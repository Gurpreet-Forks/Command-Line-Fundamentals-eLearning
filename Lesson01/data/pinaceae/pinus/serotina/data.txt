Natural range  
  
Pinus serotina, the pond pine, marsh pine or pocosin pine, is a tree found
along the Southeastern portion of the Atlantic coastal plain of the United
States, from southern New Jersey south to Florida and west to southern
Alabama. This pine often has a crooked growth pattern and an irregular top and
grows up to 21 metres (69 ft) high,[1] rarely to 29 metres (95 ft).[2]

The needles are in bundles of three or four, and 15-20 cm (6-8 in) long. The
almost round cones are 5-8 cm (2-3 1/4 in) long with small prickles on the
scales. Its cones are usually serotinous, requiring fire to open.[1] The pond
pine is found in wet habitats near ponds, bays, swamps, and pocosins.[3]

The species name serotina is derived from the persistently unopened cones that
may remain closed for several years before they release their seeds; the
opening is often in response to forest fires.

At the north end of its range, it intergrades and hybridises with pitch pine
(P. rigida); it is distinguished from that species by the longer needles and
on average slightly larger cones. Some botanists treat pond pine as a
subspecies of pitch pine.

  * Pond pine cones are smaller and rounder than loblolly pine cones. 

  * Unlike loblolly pines, pond pines have the ability to grow needles directly from the trunk.[4]
