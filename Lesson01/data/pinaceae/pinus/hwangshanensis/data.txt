## Description[edit]

Pinus hwangshanensis is an evergreen tree reaching 15-25 metres (49-82 ft) in
height, with a very broad, flat-topped crown of long, level branches. The bark
is thick, greyish, and scaly plated. The leaves are needle-like, dark green, 2
per fascicle, 5-8 cm long and 0.8-1 mm wide, the persistent fascicle sheath 1
cm long. The cones are broad squat ovoid, 4-6.5 cm long, yellow-brown, opening
when mature in late winter to 5-7 cm broad. The seeds are winged, 5-6 mm long
with a 1.5-2.5 cm wing. Pollination is in mid spring, with the cones maturing
18-20 months after. It is closely related to Japanese black pine (P.
thunbergii), differing from it in the slenderer leaves, brown (not white) buds
and broader cones.

Huangshan pines typically grow at moderate to high altitudes on steep, rocky
crags, and are a major vegetation component in the exceptional landscapes of
eastern China. Many specimens are venerated for their unique rugged shapes,
and are frequently portrayed in traditional Chinese paintings.
