Pinus lambertiana (commonly known as the sugar pine or sugar cone pine) is the
tallest and most massive pine tree, and has the longest cones of any conifer.
The species name lambertiana was given by the British botanist David Douglas,
who named the tree in honour of the English botanist, Aylmer Bourke Lambert.
It is native to the mountains of the Pacific coast of North America, from
Oregon through California to Baja California.

## Description[edit]

### Growth[edit]

The sugar pine is the tallest and largest Pinus species, commonly growing to
40-60 meters (130-195 ft) tall, exceptionally to 82 m (269 ft) tall, with a
trunk diameter of 1.5-2.5 m (4 ft 11 in-8 ft 2 in), exceptionally 3.5 m (11 ft
6 in). The tallest recorded specimen is 83.45 metres (273 ft 9 in) tall, is
located in Yosemite National Park, and was discovered in 2015. The second
tallest recorded was "Yosemite Giant", an 82.05 m (269 ft 2 in) tall specimen
in Yosemite National Park, which died from a bark beetle attack in 2007. The
tallest, known, living specimens today grow in southern Oregon and Yosemite
National Park: one in Umpqua National Forest is 77.7 m (254 ft 11 in) tall and
another in Siskiyou National Forest is 77.2 m (253 ft 3 in) tall. Yosemite
National Park also has the third tallest, measured to 80.5 m (264 ft 1 in)
tall as of June 2013; the Rim Fire affected this specimen, but it survived.

Pinus lambertiana is a member of the white pine group (Pinus subgenus Strobus)
and, like all members of that group, the leaves ("needles") grow in fascicles
("bundles") of five, with a deciduous sheath. They are 5-11 cm (2-4 1/4 in)
long.[1] Sugar pine is notable for having the longest cones of any conifer,
mostly 25-50 cm (9 3/4-19 3/4 in) long,[2] exceptionally to 66 cm (26 in)
long,[citation needed] although the cones of the Coulter pine are more
massive. The seeds are 1-2 cm (1/2-3/4 in) long, with a 2-3-centimeter (3/4-1
1/4-inch) long wing[2] that aids their dispersal by wind. According to David
Douglas, the seeds were eaten by Native Americans.[3]

### Distribution[edit]

The sugar pine occurs in the mountains of Oregon and California in the western
United States, and Baja California in northwestern Mexico; specifically the
Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, Coast Ranges, and Sierra San Pedro Martir.

### White pine blister rust[edit]

The sugar pine has been severely affected by the white pine blister rust
(Cronartium ribicola),[4] a fungus that was accidentally introduced from
Europe in 1909. A high proportion of sugar pines has been killed by the
blister rust, particularly in the northern part of the species' range that has
experienced the rust for a longer period of time. The rust has also destroyed
much of the western white pine and whitebark pine throughout their ranges.[5]
The U.S. Forest Service has a program (see link below) for developing rust-
resistant sugar pine and western white pine. Seedlings of these trees have
been introduced into the wild. The Sugar Pine Foundation in the Lake Tahoe
Basin has been successful in finding resistant sugar pine seed trees and has
demonstrated that it is important for the public to assist the U.S. Forest
Service in restoring this species. However, blister rust is much less common
in California, and sugar, western white and whitebark pines still survive in
great numbers there.[6]

## Etymology[edit]

Naturalist John Muir considered sugar pine to be the "king of the conifers".
The common name comes from the sweet resin, which Native Americans used as a
sweetener.[7] John Muir found it preferable to maple sugar.[8] It is also
known as the great sugar pine. The scientific name was assigned by David
Douglas in honor of Aylmer Bourke Lambert.

## Folklore[edit]

In the Achomawi creation myth, Annikadel, the creator, makes one of the 'First
People' by intentionally dropping a sugar pine seed in a place where it can
grow. One of the descendants in this ancestry is Sugarpine-Cone man, who has a
handsome son named Ahsoballache.[9]

After Ahsoballache marries the daughter of To'kis the Chipmunk-woman, his
grandfather insists that the new couple have a child. To this end, the
grandfather breaks open a scale from a sugar pine cone, and secretly instructs
Ahsoballache to immerse the scale's contents in spring water, then hide them
inside a covered basket. Ahsoballache performs the tasks that night; at the
next dawn, he and his wife discover the infant Edechewe near their bed.[9]

The Washo language has a word for sugar pine, simt'a:gim, and also a word for
"sugar pine sugar", nanomba.
