Picea neoveitchii (Chinese: ????) is a species of conifer in the Pinaceae
family. It is found only in China. It is threatened by habitat loss.

Picea neoveitchii is an endemic spruce species of central China. Several
scattered communities and individuals can be found growing on the southern
slopes of Qinling Mountains in Baotian Man Nature Preserve, Henan province
between 1240 and 2020 meters elevation. This spruce species is especially
vulnerable to extinction due to the high fragmentation of its natural habitat
from human disturbance. Current conservation efforts are focused on preserving
natural habitats, managing invasive species to reduce competition, and
prohibiting timber harvest. Conservation researchers emphasize the urgent need
for a restoration project which reintroduces seedlings across the tree's
original range (within protected forest areas), and protects wild communities
and individuals. (Zhang et al. 2006).
