Picea breweriana, known as Brewer spruce,[2][3] Brewer's weeping spruce, or
weeping spruce, is a species of spruce native to western North America, where
it is one of the rarest on the continent, endemic to the Klamath Mountains of
southwest Oregon and northwest California. The specific epithet breweriana is
in honor of the American botanist William Henry Brewer.[4][5]

DNA analyses[6][7] have shown that Picea breweriana has a basal position in
the Picea clade,[6] suggesting that Picea originated in North America.

It grows at moderately high altitudes, from 1000-2700 m.[8][9][10][11][12]

It is a large evergreen coniferous tree growing to 20-40 m tall, exceptionally
54 m, and with a trunk diameter of up to 1.5 m. The bark is thin and scaly,
and purple-gray in color. The crown is very distinct, distinguished by level
branches with vertically pendulous branchlets, each branch forming a 'curtain'
of foliage. The pendulous foliage only develops when the tree grows to about
1.5-2 m tall; young trees smaller than this (up to about 10-20 years old) are
open-crowned with sparse, level branchlets. The shoots are orange-brown, with
dense short pubescence about 0.2 mm long and very rough with pulvini 1-2 mm
long.

The leaves are borne singly on the pulvini, and are needle-like, 15-35 mm
long, flattened in cross-section, glossy dark green above, and with two bands
of white stomata below.[8][9] The cones are longer than most other North
American spruces, pendulous, cylindrical, 8-15 cm long and 2 cm broad when
closed, opening to 3-4 cm broad. They have smoothly rounded, thin, flexible
scales 2 cm long. The immature cones are dark purple, maturing red-brown 5-7
months after pollination. The seeds are black, 3-4 mm long, with a slender,
12-18 mm long pale brown wing.[8][9]

Picea breweriana grows very slowly, typically less than 20 cm (8 in) per year.
It occurs mainly on ridgetop sites with very heavy winter snow to provide a
steady source of meltwater through the spring, but dry in the summer. The
harsh ridgetop conditions minimize competition from other much faster-growing
trees like Douglas-fir. It is very well adapted to cope with heavy snow and
ice loads, with tough branches, and the drooping branchlets shedding snow
readily.[8][9][13]

Outside its native range, P. breweriana is a highly valued ornamental tree in
gardens, particularly in Great Britain and Scandinavia, where it is
appreciated for its dramatically pendulous foliage.[9] This plant has gained
the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[14][15]
