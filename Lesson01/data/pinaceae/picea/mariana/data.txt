Picea mariana, the black spruce, is a North American species of spruce tree in
the pine family. It is widespread across Canada, found in all 10 provinces and
all 3 Arctic territories. Its range extends into northern parts of the United
States: in Alaska, the Great Lakes region, and the upper Northeast. It is a
frequent part of the biome known as taiga or boreal forest.[3][4][5][6][7]

The Latin specific epithet mariana means "of the Virgin Mary".[8]

## Description[edit]

Needles and cones

Picea mariana is a slow-growing, small upright evergreen coniferous tree
(rarely a shrub), having a straight trunk with little taper, a scruffy habit,
and a narrow, pointed crown of short, compact, drooping branches with upturned
tips. Through much of its range it averages 5-15 m (15-50 ft) tall with a
trunk 15-50 cm (6-20 in) diameter at maturity, though occasional specimens can
reach 30 m (98 ft) tall and 60 cm (24 in) diameter. The bark is thin, scaly,
and grayish brown. The leaves are needle-like, 6-15 mm (1/4-9/16 in) long,
stiff, four-sided, dark bluish green on the upper sides, paler glaucous green
below. The cones are the smallest of all of the spruces, 1.5-4 cm (1/2-1 1/2
in) long and 1-2 cm (1/2-3/4 in) broad, spindle-shaped to nearly round, dark
purple ripening red-brown, produced in dense clusters in the upper crown,
opening at maturity but persisting for several years.[3][4]

Natural hybridization occurs regularly with the closely related Picea rubens
(red spruce), and very rarely with Picea glauca (white spruce).[3]

It differs from P. glauca in having a dense cover of small hairs on the bark
of young branch tips, an often darker reddish-brown bark, shorter needles,
smaller and rounder cones, and a preference for wetter lowland areas. Numerous
differences in details of its needle and pollen morphology also exist but
require careful microscopic examination to detect. From true firs, such as
Abies balsamea (balsam fir), it differs in having pendulous cones, persistent
woody leaf-bases, and four-angled needles, arranged all round the shoots.

Due to the large difference between heartwood and sapwood moisture content, it
is easy to distinguish these two wood characteristics in ultrasound images,[9]
which are widely used as a nondestructive technique to assess the internal
condition of the tree and avoid useless log breakdown.

Older taxonomic synonyms include Abies mariana, Picea brevifolia, or Picea
nigra.

## Ecology[edit]

Growth varies with site quality. In swamp and muskeg it shows progressively
slower growth rates from the edges toward the centre. The roots are shallow
and wide spreading, resulting in susceptibility to windthrow. In the northern
part of its range, ice pruned asymmetric black spruce are often seen with
diminished foliage on the windward side.[10] Tilted trees colloquially called
"drunken trees" are associated with thawing of permafrost.[3][11]

In the southern portion of its range it is found primarily on wet organic
soils, but farther north its abundance on uplands increases. In the Great
Lakes States it is most abundant in peat bogs and swamps, also on transitional
sites between peatlands and uplands. In these areas it is rare on uplands,
except in isolated areas of northern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan.

Most stands are even-aged due to frequent fire intervals in black spruce
forests. It commonly grows in pure stands on organic soils and in mixed stands
on mineral soils. It is tolerant of nutrient-poor soils, and is commonly found
on poorly drained acidic peatlands. It is considered a climax species over
most of its range; however, some ecologists question whether black spruce
forests truly attain climax because fires usually occur at 50 to 150 year
intervals, while "stable" conditions may not be attained for several hundred
years.[3]

The frequent fire return interval, a natural fire ecology, perpetuates
numerous successional communities. Throughout boreal North America, Betula
papyrifera (paper birch) and Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen) are
successional hardwoods that frequently invade burns in black spruce. Black
spruce typically seeds in promptly after fire, and with the continued absence
of fire, eventually dominates the hardwoods.

It is a pioneer that invades the sedge mat in filled-lake bogs, though often
preceded slightly by Larix laricina (tamarack), with which it may in time form
a stable forest cover in swamps. However, as the peat soil is gradually
elevated by the accumulation of organic matter, and the fertility of the site
improves, balsam fir and Thuja occidentalis (eastern arborvitae) eventually
replaces black spruce and tamarack.

The spruce budworm, a moth larva, causes defoliation which kills trees if it
occurs several years in a row, though black spruce is less susceptible than
white spruce or balsam fir. Trees most at risk are those growing with balsam
fir and white spruce.[12]

## Cultivation[edit]

Numerous cultivars have been selected for use in parks and gardens. The
cultivar P. mariana 'Nana' is a dwarf form which has gained the Royal
Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[13][14]

## Uses and symbolism[edit]

Black spruce is the provincial tree of Newfoundland and Labrador.

The timber is of low value due to the small size of the trees, but it is an
important source of pulpwood and the primary source of it in Canada.[15] Fast-
food chopsticks are often made from black spruce.[5]

However, it is increasingly being used for making cross laminated timber by
companies such as Nordic Structures, which allows the high strength due to the
tight growth rings to be assembled into larger timbers.[16]
