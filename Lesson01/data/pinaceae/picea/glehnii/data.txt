Picea glehnii, the Sakhalin spruce'[2][3] or Glehn's spruce, is a species of
conifer in the Pinaceae family. It was named after a Russian botanist,
taxonomist, Sakhalin and Amur river regions explorer, geographer and
hydrographer Peter von Glehn[4] (1835--1876), the person who was the first to
describe this conifer. In Japan people call this tree ??????, which means "red
spruce".

## Natural habitat[edit]

Picea glehnii

The spruce's natural habitat is situated on Hokkaido Island. It also appears
on Mount Hayachine of the Kitakami range in the Northern part of Honshu (Iwate
prefecture), as well as in the Southern part of Russian island Sakhalin (along
Aniva Bay, in the Mereya river valley, near Bolshoye Vavaiskoye lake and Busse
lagoon). The tree also grows on Southern Kuril Islands (Kunashir, Shikotan and
Southern Iturup).

Glehn's spruce grows within the range of 0 to 1600 meters above sea level in
low places and on cold and excessively wet soil on rocky subsoil.

## Description[edit]

The tree has thick cone-shaped branches with a trunk of about 62-73
centimeters in diameter. Spruces on Sakhalin grow as high as 17 meters, while
some specimens growing on Japanese mountains are even 30 meters tall. Old
trees' bark is scaly and placoid and is colored in chocolate brown (this is
the feature that distinguishes this species from others). Young sprouts are
usually orange or wine red, haired in grooves and on stalk 1 millimeter in
length. The buds are usually 3-7 millimeters long, nearly 5 millimeters wide
and have a conical or ovoid form. The color of buds is reddish brown and they
are slightly covered with resin. Their scales are triangle- or trigonal-shaped
with a long awl-like tip.

The tree's needles are about 10 millimeters long and 2,5 millimeters wide.
They are four-sided and a bit curved, mature trees have blunt needles, while
young ones have pointed bluish-green ones. When a needle is rubbed, it smells
harsh.

The cone has an oblong ovoid or oval form with almost flat base. It is 2-4
centimeters thick and 3,6-8,7 centimeters long. Its color is purple or green,
brown and dark-red when mature with inversely ovoid seed scale and dark-red
and brown base. The light-brown seeds are 2-2,4 centimeters long with
yellowish orange wings which are 2-3 times longer than the seed itself.

The tree is shadow and frost tolerant. In planting it is well matched with
Dahurian larch.

## Hybrids[edit]

The tree makes a Picea x nothohybrid with Yezo spruce (Picea jezoensis).

## Conservation[edit]

The spruce is included into the Red Book of Sakhalin region, it is also kept
under protection in Japanese national parks, especially in the area of Honshu
Island.
