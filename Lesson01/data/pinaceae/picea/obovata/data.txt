Picea obovata, the Siberian spruce, is a spruce native to Siberia, from the
Ural Mountains east to Magadan Oblast, and from the Arctic tree line south to
the Altay Mountains in northwestern Mongolia.

## Description and uses[edit]

It is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 15-35 m tall, and with a trunk
diameter of up to 1.5 m, and a conical crown with drooping branchlets. The
shoots are orange-brown, with variably scattered to dense pubescence. The
leaves are needle-like, 1-2 cm long, rhombic in cross-section, shiny green to
grayish-green with inconspicuous stomatal lines; the leaves subtending a bud
are distinctively angled out at a greater angle than the rest of the leaves (a
character shared by only two or three other spruces). The cones are cylindric-
conic, 5-10 cm long and 1.5-2 cm broad, green or purple, maturing glossy brown
4-6 months after pollination, and have stiff, smoothly rounded scales.

It is an important timber tree in Russia, the wood being used for general
construction and paper making. The leaves are used to make spruce beer.

Siberian spruce cone-scales are used as food by the caterpillars of the
tortrix moth Cydia illutana.

## Taxonomy and systematics[edit]

Siberian spruce and Norway spruce (Picea abies) have turned out to be
extremely similar genetically and might be considered two closely related
subspecies of P. abies.[3]

Siberian spruce hybridises extensively with Norway spruce where the two
species (or subspecies) meet in northeastern Europe; trees over a broad area
from extreme northeast Norway and northern Finland east to the Ural Mountains
are classified as the hybrid Picea x fennica (Regel) Komarov (or P. abies
subsp. xfennica, if the two taxa are considered subspecies); they differ from
typical P. obovata from east of the Urals in having cones with less smoothly
rounded, often triangular-pointed, scales.
