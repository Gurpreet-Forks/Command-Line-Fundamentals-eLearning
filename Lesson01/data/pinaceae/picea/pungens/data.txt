The blue spruce, green spruce,[2] white spruce,[3] Colorado spruce, or
Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of
spruce tree. It is native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States. Its
natural range extends from northern New Mexico through Colorado and Utah to
Wyoming and into far southwest Montana, but it has been widely introduced
elsewhere and is used as an ornamental tree in many places far beyond its
native range. The blue spruce has blue coloured needles and is a coniferous
tree.

## Description[edit]

In the wild, Picea pungens grows to about 23 m (75 ft), but when planted in
parks and gardens it seldom exceeds 15 m (49 ft) tall by 5 m (16 ft) wide. It
is a columnar or conical evergreen conifer with densely growing horizontal
branches. It has scaly grey bark on the trunk with yellowish-brown branches.

Waxy gray-green leaves, up to 3 cm (1 in) long, are arranged radially on the
shoots which curve upwards. The pale brown cones are up to 10 cm (4 in)
long.[4][5][6][7]

The specific epithet pungens means "sharply pointed", referring to the
leaves.[8]

The blue spruce is the State Tree of Colorado.[9]

## Cultivation[edit]

Picea pungens and its many cultivars are often grown as ornamental trees in
gardens and parks.[5][6][10] It is also grown for the Christmas tree
industry.[5]

### Pests and diseases[edit]

The blue spruce is attacked by two species of Adelges, an aphid-like insect
that causes galls to form. Nymphs of the pineapple gall adelgid form galls at
the base of twigs which resemble miniature pineapples and those of the
Cooley's spruce gall adelgid cause cone-shaped galls at the tips of branches.
The larva of the spruce budworm eat the buds and growing shoots while the
spruce needle miner hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a
webbed mass. An elongated white scale insect, the pine needle scale feeds on
the needles causing fluffy white patches on the twigs and aphids also suck sap
from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback. Mites can
also infest the blue spruce, especially in a dry summer, causing yellowing of
the oldest needles.[11][12] Another insect pest is the spruce beetle
(Dendroctonus rufipennis) which bores under the bark. It often first attacks
trees which have blown over by the wind and when the larvae mature two years
afterwards, a major outbreak occurs and vast numbers of beetles attack nearby
standing trees.[13]

The blue spruce is susceptible to several needle casting diseases which cause
the needles to turn yellow, mottled or brown before they fall off. Various
rust diseases also affect the tree causing yellowing of the needles as well as
needle fall. Canker caused by Cytospora attacks one of the lower branches
first and progressively makes its way higher up the tree. The first symptom is
the needles turning reddish-brown and falling off. Meanwhile, patches of white
resin appear on the bark and the branch eventually dies.[11]

### Cultivars[edit]

Foliage of the cultivar 'Glauca globosa'

Common cultivars (those marked agm have gained the Royal Horticultural
Society's Award of Garden Merit):[14]

  * 'Glauca Globosa'agm[15] - shrub from 3-5 feet (0.91-1.52 m) in height[16]
  * 'Fat Albert' - compact perfect cone to 10 feet (3.0 m) of a silver blue color[17]
  * 'Glauca Jean's Dilly' - shrub from 3-6 feet (0.91-1.83 m) in height[18]
  * 'Glauca Pendula' - drooping branches, spreads to about 8 feet (2.4 m) wide by 4 feet (1.2 m) tall[19]
  * 'Hoopsii' agm[20]
  * 'Koster'[21]
  * 'Baby Blue Eyes'[22][23]
  * 'Baby Blue' [24]

## Uses[edit]

The Navajo and Keres Native Americans used this tree as a traditional
medicinal plant and a ceremonial item, and twigs are given as gifts to bring
good fortune. In traditional medicine, an infusion of the needles is used to
treat colds and settle the stomach. This liquid is also used externally for
rheumatic pains. Early people used their wood for building.[25]
