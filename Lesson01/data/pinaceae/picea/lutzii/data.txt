Picea x lutzii is a hybrid spruce tree that is a natural cross between white
spruce and Sitka spruce occurring where the ranges of the two species overlap
in coastal south-central Alaska and coastal British Columbia. Its common name
is Lutz spruce. Its morphology is intermediate between the two parent species,
the maritime Sitka spruce and the white spruce of dryer climates further
inland. In addition to the parent spruces it shares its ecosystem with Tsuga
heterophylla and T. mertensiana.[1][2][3] The tree was named for Harold John
Lutz, a scientist who specialized in forest soils and worked briefly for the
United States Forest Service in Alaska where he collected the material used to
describe the hybrid.[4] A Lutz spruce from Alaska's Chugach National Forest
was selected in 2015 for the Capitol Christmas Tree.[5] This is the first
Capitol Tree that has come from the state of Alaska.

Lutz's spruce grows as tall as 30 meters in height, and it is a generally
symmetrical tree with open and downward bowing branches. While its needles are
sharp like the Sitka spruce, they are not as "stiff" and, therefore, less
"prickly." The seed cones closely resemble those of the Sitka spruce but are
smaller and with the rounded tops of white spruce cones.[6]

Between 1987 and 2000 the largest known epidemic of spruce bark beetle
(Dendroctonus rufipennis) caused the death of 90% of white, Sitka, and hybrid
Lutz spruce, almost all of the mature spruce trees, in a 3.2 million acre
forest in the Kenai Peninsula and Copper River. The spruce bark beetle is a
part of the native ecosystem, mainly hosted by the white spruce of the dryer
interior, in south-central Alaska where the tree loss occurred in apparently
healthy old growth forest.[7] One theory about the decimation of trees is that
warmer spring and summer temperatures have allowed the beetles an annual
reproductive cycle, shortened from every two to three years, while warmer
winter temperatures have increased the number of beetles that live through
winter to reproduce in spring. In addition to increased temperatures,
increased aridity in the region has created dryer forests lowering the
production of sap, a barrier defense against insect and fungal pests, in the
spruces.[8][9] Lutz spruces, like its primary host, the white spruce, are more
susceptible than Sitka spruce and black spruce to bark beetle damage and
suffer a higher mortality rate when infected.[10]
