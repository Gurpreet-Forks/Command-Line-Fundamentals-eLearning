Picea schrenkiana, Schrenk's spruce,[1] or Asian spruce,[1] is a spruce native
to the Tian Shan mountains of central Asia in western China (Xinjiang),
Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.[1] It grows at altitudes of 1,200-3,500 metres,[2]
usually in pure forests, sometimes mixed with the Tien Shan variety of
Siberian fir (Abies sibirica var. semenovii). Its name was given in honour of
Alexander von Schrenk (1816-1876).

## Description[edit]

Picea schrenkiana tree in Rogow Arboretum, Poland

Picea schrenkiana is a large evergreen tree growing to 40-50 metres (130-160
ft) tall (rarely to 60 metres (200 ft)), with a trunk diameter of up to 1-2
metres (3.3-6.6 ft). It has a narrow conical crown with level branches and
sometimes pendulous branchlets. The shoots are pale buff-brown, and glabrous
(hairless). The leaves are needle-like, 1.5-3.5 cm long, rhombic in cross-
section, dark green with inconspicuous stomatal lines.

The cones are cylindric-conic, 6-12 cm long and 2 cm broad, purple when young,
maturing dark brown and opening to 2.5-3.5 cm broad 5-7 months after
pollination; the scales are moderately stiff and smoothly rounded.

### Subspecies[edit]

There are two subspecies:

  * Picea schrenkiana subsp. schrenkiana. Eastern Tian Shan, in Kazakhstan and Xinjiang. Leaves longer, 2-3.5 cm long.
  * Picea schrenkiana subsp. tianshanica (Rupr.) Bykov. Western Tian Shan, in Kyrgyzstan. Leaves shorter, 1.5-2.5 cm long.

It is closely related to, and in many respects intermediate between Morinda
spruce (Picea smithiana) from further south in the Himalaya, and Siberian
spruce (Picea obovata) further north in Siberia.

## Uses[edit]

Schrenk's spruce is an important tree in central Asia for timber and paper
production, where few other large trees exist. Its slower growth compared to
Norway Spruce reduces its importance outside of its native range.

## Cultivation[edit]

Picea schrenkiana is grown as an ornamental tree in large gardens and public
parks in Europe.
