Picea koyamae (Koyama's spruce; Japanese: ???????? or ???????? yatsugatake-
tohhi) is a rare spruce, endemic to the Akaishi Mountains and Yatsugatake
Mountains in central Honshu, Japan. It is an evergreen tree growing to 25 m
(82 ft) tall, with a trunk diameter of up to a metre. It grows in small
isolated stands in a limited area and the total area of occupation is less
than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi). Trees that are lost to typhoons are
normally replaced with other faster-growing species and the International
Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the tree as "critically
endangered". Some trees are in cultivation as an ornamental tree.

## Description[edit]

It is a monoecious evergreen tree growing to 25 m tall, with a trunk diameter
of up to 1 m. The shoots are orange-brown, with scattered pubescence. The
leaves are needle-like, 8-16 mm long, rhombic in cross-section, dark bluish-
green with conspicuous stomatal lines. The cones are cylindric-conic, 4-9 cm
long and 2 cm broad, maturing pale brown 5-7 months after pollination, and
have stiff, smoothly rounded scales 6-18 mm long and 6-12 mm wide. Pollination
takes place in late spring.[2][3]

## Distribution[edit]

Koyama's spruce is native to the Akaishi Mountains and Yatsugatake Mountains,
or Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures in central Honshu, Japan, where it grows
at 1500-2000 m altitude.[2] It is found growing in groups of 10-20, with a
total population of only about 250 mature trees. The main cause of decline is
the loss of natural regeneration after typhoons, with windblown trees being
replaced by the planting of other faster-growing commercially valuable
species. Other threats include wildfires, landslides and changes in
temperature and precipitation associated with climate change. There is little
genetic exchange between different fragmentary locations where it grows, and
the total area of occupation by this tree is less than 100 square kilometres
(39 sq mi).[1][2]

The tree is named after the Japanese botanist Mitsua Koyama. The name was
first published as "koyamai", but this is an orthographical error to be
corrected under the provisions of ICBN Article 60.[4]

It is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree. The wood is similar to that
of other spruces, but the species is too rare to be of economic value.
