Picea koraiensis, the Korean spruce,[2] is a species of spruce. It is called
Jel koreiskaya in Russian and Hongpi yunshan in Chinese.

It is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 30 m tall, and with a trunk
diameter of up to 0.8 m. The shoots are orange-brown, glabrous or with
scattered pubescence. The leaves are needle-like, 12-22 mm long, rhombic in
cross-section, dark bluish-green with conspicuous stomatal lines. The cones
are cylindric-conic, 4-8 cm long and 2 cm broad, maturing pale brown 5-7
months after pollination, and have stiff, smoothly rounded scales.

Its population is stable though low, and there are no known protocols that
protect it. It is found mostly in North Korea near the Yalu River, and in
Russia near the Ussuri River. In China it is restricted north-eastern
provinces Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning. It is also believed that it might
possibly occur in areas in southern Ussuriland.

It is closely related to Koyama's spruce (Picea koyamae), and treated as
synonymous with it by some botanists.
