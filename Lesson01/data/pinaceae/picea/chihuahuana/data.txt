Picea chihuahuana, the Chihuahua spruce, is a medium-sized evergreen tree
growing to 25-35 m tall, and with a trunk diameter of up to 1 m. It is native
to northwest Mexico, where it occurs in 25 small populations in the Sierra
Madre Occidental mountains in Chihuahua and Durango. It grows at moderate
altitudes from 2300-3200 m, growing along streamsides in mountain valleys,
where moisture levels in the soil are greater than the otherwise low rainfall
in the area would suggest.

The bark is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates 5-10 cm
across. The crown is conic, with widely spaced branches with drooping
branchlets. The shoots are stout, pale buff-brown, glabrous, and with
prominent pulvini. The leaves are needle-like, 17-23 mm long, stout, rhombic
in cross-section, bright glaucous blue-green with conspicuous lines of
stomata; the tip is viciously sharp.

The cones are pendulous, broad cylindrical, 7-12 cm long and 3 cm broad when
closed, opening to 4-5 cm broad. They have stiff, bluntly rounded scales 1.5-2
cm broad, and are green, maturing pale brown 6-8 months after pollination. The
seeds are black, 4 mm long, with a 10-13 mm long pale brown wing.

Chihuahua spruce was only discovered in 1942 by the Mexican botanist Maximino
Martinez, and is endangered with just 25 small populations, none comprising
more than a few hundred trees. It is related to Martinez Spruce from northeast
Mexico, but differs in the shorter, blue-green leaves, and the smaller,
narrower cones with smaller scales. No other related spruces are found in
North America, with its next-closest relatives in eastern Asia.

It is a very attractive tree and is starting to be planted as an ornamental
tree in botanical gardens, particularly valued in warm areas as it is one of
the most heat-tolerant of all spruces, more tolerant of summer heat than Blue
Spruce, which it resembles in foliage.
