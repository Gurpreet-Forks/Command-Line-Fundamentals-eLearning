Cedrus deodara, the deodar cedar, Himalayan cedar, or
deodar/devdar/devadar/devadaru, is a species of cedar native to the western
Himalayas in Eastern Afghanistan, Northern Pakistan (especially in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa) and India (Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Sikkim and, Arunachal Pradesh states and the Darjeeling Region of West
Bengal), Southwestern Tibet and Western Nepal, occurring at 1,500-3,200 m
(4,921-10,499 ft) altitude. It is a large evergreen coniferous tree reaching
40-50 m (131-164 ft) tall, exceptionally 60 m (197 ft) with a trunk up to 3 m
(10 ft) in diameter. It has a conic crown with level branches and drooping
branchlets.[2]

The leaves are needle-like, mostly 2.5-5 cm (0.98-1.97 in) long, occasionally
up to 7 cm (2.8 in) long, slender (1 mm (0.039 in) thick), borne singly on
long shoots, and in dense clusters of 20-30 on short shoots; they vary from
bright green to glaucous blue-green in colour. The female cones are barrel-
shaped, 7-13 cm (2.8-5.1 in) long and 5-9 cm (2.0-3.5 in) broad, and
disintegrate when mature (in 12 months) to release the winged seeds. The male
cones are 4-6 cm (1.6-2.4 in) long, and shed their pollen in autumn.[2]

## Etymology[edit]

The botanical name, which is also the English common name, derives from the
Sanskrit term devadaru, which means "wood of the gods", a compound of deva
"god" and daru "wood and tree".

## Cultural importance in the Indian subcontinent[edit]

Among Hindus, as the etymology of deodar suggests, it is worshiped as a divine
tree. Deva, the first half of the Sanskrit term, means divine, deity, or deus.
Daru, the second part, is cognate with (related to) the words durum, druid,
tree, and true.[3][4]

Several Hindu legends refer to this tree. For example, Valmiki Ramayan -
Kishkinda khanda- stanza 4-43-13 reads:[5]

> lodhra padmaka khaNDeSu devadaaru vaneSu ca |

>

> raavaNaH saha vaidehyaa maargitavyaa tataH tataH || || 4-43-13

> That means "In the stands of Lodhra trees,[6] Padmaka trees [7] and in the
woods of Devadaru, or Deodar trees, Ravana is to be searched there and there,
together with Sita. [4-43-13]"

Forests full of Deodar or Devadaru trees were the favorite living place of
ancient Indian sages and their families who were devoted to the Hindu god
Shiva. To please Lord Shiva, the sages used to perform very difficult tapasya
(meditation) practices in deodar forests. Also the ancient Hindu epics and
Shaivite texts regularly mention Darukavana, meaning a forest of deodars, as a
sacred place.[citation needed]

The deodar is the national tree of Pakistan.[8]

## Cultivation[edit]

It is widely grown as an ornamental tree, often planted in parks and large
gardens for its drooping foliage. General cultivation is limited to areas with
mild winters, with trees frequently killed by temperatures below about -25 ?C
(-13 ?F), limiting it to USDA zone 7 and warmer for reliable growth.[9] It can
succeed in rather cool-summer climates, as in Stateline, Nevada, and Ushuaia,
Argentina.[10]

The most cold-tolerant trees originate in the northwest of the species' range
in Kashmir and Paktia Province, Afghanistan. Selected cultivars from this
region are hardy to USDA zone 7 or even zone 6, tolerating temperatures down
to about -30 ?C (-22 ?F).[9] Named cultivars from this region include
'Eisregen', 'Eiswinter', 'Karl Fuchs', 'Kashmir', 'Polar Winter', and
'Shalimar'.[11][12] Of these, 'Eisregen', 'Eiswinter', 'Karl Fuchs', and
'Polar Winter' were selected in Germany from seed collected in Paktia;
'Kashmir' was a selection of the nursery trade, whereas 'Shalimar' originated
from seeds collected in 1964 from Shalimar Gardens, India (in the Kashmir
region) and propagated at the Arnold Arboretum.[11]

C. deodara,[13] and the two cultivars 'Feelin' Blue'[14] and 'Aurea',[15] have
gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed
2017).[16]

## Uses[edit]

### Construction material[edit]

Deodar is in great demand as building material because of its durability, rot-
resistant character and fine, close grain, which is capable of taking a high
polish. Its historical use to construct religious temples and in landscaping
around temples is well recorded. Its rot-resistant character also makes it an
ideal wood for constructing the well-known houseboats of Srinagar, Kashmir. In
Pakistan and India, during the British colonial period, deodar wood was used
extensively for construction of barracks, public buildings, bridges, canals
and railway cars.[4] Despite its durability, it is not a strong timber, and
its brittle nature makes it unsuitable for delicate work where strength is
required, such as chair-making.[citation needed]

### Herbal Ayurveda[edit]

C. deodara is used in Ayurvedic medicine.[4][17]

The inner wood is aromatic and used to make incense. Inner wood is distilled
into essential oil. As insects avoid this tree, the essential oil is used as
insect repellent on the feet of horses, cattle and camels. It also has
antifungal properties and has some potential for control of fungal
deterioration of spices during storage.[citation needed] The outer bark and
stem are astringent.[18]

Because of its antifungal and insect repellent properties, rooms made of
deodar cedar wood are used to store meat and food grains like oats and wheat
in Shimla, Kullu, and Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh.

Cedar oil is often used for its aromatic properties, especially in
aromatherapy. It has a characteristic woody odor which may change somewhat in
the course of drying out. The crude oils are often yellowish or darker in
color. Its applications cover soap perfumes, household sprays, floor polishes
and insecticides and is also used in microscope work as a clearing oil.[18]

## Chemistry[edit]

The bark of Cedrus deodara contains large amounts of taxifolin.[19] The wood
contains cedeodarin, ampelopsin, cedrin, cedrinoside,[20] and deodarin
(3?,4?,5,6-tetrahydroxy-8-methyl dihydroflavonol).[21] The main components of
the needle essential oil include ?-terpineol (30.2%), linalool (24.47%),
limonene (17.01%), anethole (14.57%), caryophyllene (3.14%), and eugenol
(2.14%).[22] The deodar cedar also contains lignans[23] and the phenolic
sesquiterpene himasecolone, together with isopimaric acid.[24] Other compounds
have been identified, including (-)-matairesinol, (-)-nortrachelogenin, and a
dibenzylbutyrolactollignan
(4,4',9-trihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-9,9'-epoxylignan).[25]
