Natural range of Larix lyallii  
  
Larix lyallii, the subalpine larch, or simply alpine larch, is a deciduous,
coniferous tree native to northwestern North America. It lives at high
altitudes--1,800 to 2,400 m (5,900 to 7,900 ft)--in the Rocky Mountains of
Idaho, Montana, British Columbia, and Alberta. There is a disjunct population
in the Cascade Range of Washington.

Subalpine larch is hardy and can survive at low temperatures and on thin rocky
soils; the tree is often found near treeline. However, it can grow in a
variety of soils and with or without shade, as long as the soil is moist but
well-drained.

## Description[edit]

Fall foliage and cone

Larix lyallii is a small tree, growing from 10 to 25 m (33 to 82 ft) tall and
shorter at higher elevations. It has a straight trunk with a sparse and
somewhat conical crown. The branches are horizontal to the trunk, irregularly
spaced and twisted. The twigs are finely hairy. The needles are four-angled,
20 to 35 mm (0.79 to 1.38 in) long and crowded in groups of 30 to 40 on short
spurs. They are pale blue-green and deciduous, turning golden yellow in
autumn.

The seed cones, 2.5 to 4 cm (0.98 to 1.57 in) long, are red-purple when young
but become dark brown with age. They have thin scales and narrow bracts that
extend over the scales. The bark is thin and turns from yellow-gray to dark
red-brown with age. It also becomes deeply furrowed into small, scaly plates.

The tree is also one of the longest lived tree species. There is record of a
specimen in Kananaskis, Alberta which has been estimated (extrapolated) to be
~2000 years old, the oldest tree in Canada.[2][3]

## Uses[edit]

The bark contains tannin and the wood is strong, heavy, and durable.
