## Description[edit]

Larix gmelinii is a medium-sized deciduous coniferous tree reaching 10-30 m
tall, rarely 40 m, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter. The crown is broad conic;
both the main branches and the side branches are level, the side branches only
rarely drooping. The shoots are dimorphic, with growth divided into long
shoots (typically 5-30 cm long) and bearing several buds, and short shoots
only 1-2 mm long with only a single bud. The leaves are needle-like, light
green, 2-3 cm long; they turn bright yellow to orange before they fall in the
autumn, leaving the variably downy reddish-brown shoots bare until the next
spring.

The cones are erect, ovoid, 1-2 cm (rarely 2.5 cm) long, with 15-25 moderately
reflexed seed scales; they are green (rarely purple) when immature, turning
brown and opening to release the seeds when mature, 3-5 months after
pollination. The old cones commonly remain on the tree for many years, turning
dull grey-black.

## Taxonomy and systematics[edit]

There are three varieties:

  * Larix gmelinii var. gmelinii. Most of the species' range, from the Yenisei Valley east to Kamchatka.
  * Larix gmelinii var. japonica. The Kuril Islands and Sakhalin (both formerly Japanese territory).
  * Larix gmelinii var. olgensis. North Korea, Heilongjiang, and the Sikhote-Alin mountains of Primorsky Krai, Russia. Sometimes treated as a distinct species Larix olgensis.[2]

The closely related Prince Rupprecht's larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii) is
treated as a fourth variety (L. gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii) by many
botanists; it occurs in a disjunct region in the Wutai Shan mountains west of
Beijing, separated from typical L. gmelinii by about 1000 km, and differs in
having larger (2-4 cm) cones with more scales.

Dahurian larch intergrades with the closely related Siberian larch L. sibirica
of central and western Siberia where their ranges meet along the Yenisei
Valley; the resulting hybrid is named Larix x czekanowskii.

The scientific name honours Johann Georg Gmelin. Due to the species'
variability, it has acquired numerous synonyms in the botanical literature,
including L. cajanderi, L. dahurica, L. kamtschatica, L. komarovii, L.
kurilensis, L. lubarskii, L. ochotensis.

## Ecology and uses[edit]

Dahurian larch forest, Kolyma region, arctic northeast Siberia

Larix gmelinii forms enormous forests in the eastern Siberian taiga, growing
at 50-1,200 m altitude on both boggy and well-drained soils, including on the
shallow soils above permafrost. It is unique in two respects, being the
northernmost tree in the world, reaching 73? 04' 32" N 102? 00' 00" E as
creeping forms of the trees in the tundra of the Taymyr Peninsula, 72? 55' 07"
N 106? 08' E as comparatively vertical growing single trees, 72? 31' N 105?
03' E at Lukunsky grove and 72? 28' N 102? 15' E at Ary-Mas as the subtundra
sparse forests which are situated both in the Taymyr Peninsula, Khatanga river
basin,[3] and also the most cold-hardy tree in the world, tolerating
temperatures below -70 ?C in the Oymyakon-Verkhoyansk region of Yakutia.[4]
One tree in Yakutia was recorded as being 919 years old.[5]

Dahurian larch is occasionally grown in botanical gardens in Europe and North
America; it is not an easy tree to grow in areas with mild winters as it is
adapted to a long period of winter rest; the warm winter weather in Britain
can tempt it into leaf as early as the start of January, with the tender young
leaves then being killed by the next frost. In its native region, daily
minimum temperatures above freezing do not occur until late May or June, with
no further frost until the brief summer is over.

Larix gmelinii cone scales are used as food by the caterpillars of the tortrix
moth Cydia illutana.
