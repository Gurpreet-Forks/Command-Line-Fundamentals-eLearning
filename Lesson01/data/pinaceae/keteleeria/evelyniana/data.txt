## Taxonomic notes[edit]

Syn: Keteleeria delavayi Van Tieghem 1891; K. dopiana Flous 1936; K. roulletii
Flous 1936; K. hainanensis Chun et Tsiang 1963; K. evelyniana var. pendula
Hsueh 1983.[2] Farjon (1989)[3] provides a thorough taxonomic review of the
genus.

## Range and ecology[edit]

Laos, Vietnam (as far south as the Plateau of Lang Bian near Da Lat), and
China: SW Sichuan, Yunnan (where it probably intergrades with K. davidiana),
and possibly the central mountains of Hainan.[2]

Keteleeria evelyniana grows in Vietnam at elevations above 500 metres (1,600
ft)[4] and is shade intolerant, prefers neutral soils, and is typically
associated with Pinus spp. or with species of Fagaceae and Lauraceae.[2] It is
the most widespread conifer in NW Vietnam.[4]

## Cultivation and uses[edit]

Timber is insect resistant and is useful for construction and household
furniture making.[4] Used in construction, railroad ties, mine timbering and
sundry house implements. The seeds are rich in essential oil that can be used
for burning and soap manufacturing. The tree can also be used in medicine.[2]

In mid-December 2009, a Keteleeria evelyniana located in Seattle's Washington
Park Arboretum was cut down. It was thought that the unknown person who was
responsible for the cutting down of the tree took it for a Christmas tree. The
tree was planted in 1998, transplanted from China's Yunnan province.[5]

In 2013, the species was listed as vulnerable on The IUCN Red List of
Threatened Species after a 2010 assessment which found the tree's population
to be in significant decline and fragmented.[1]
