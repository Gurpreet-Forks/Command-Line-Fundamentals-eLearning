Abies vejarii is a species of fir native to northeastern Mexico, in the states
of Coahuila and Nuevo Leon, where it grows at high altitudes (2,000-3,300 m)
in the Sierra Madre Oriental.[1][2]

It is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 35-40 m tall. The leaves are
needle-like, moderately flattened, 1-2.5 cm long and 1.3-2 mm wide by 1 mm
thick, grey-green with scattered stomata above, and with two greenish-white
bands of stomata below. The tip of the leaf is acutely pointed. The cones are
glaucous purple, maturing grey-brown, 6-15 cm long and 4-6 cm broad, with
about 150-200 scales, each scale with a bract of which the apical 3-8 mm is
exserted on the closed cone, and two winged seeds; they disintegrate when
mature to release the seeds.[2] Named after Octavio Vejar Vazquez, at the
time, Mexican Minister for Public Education.
