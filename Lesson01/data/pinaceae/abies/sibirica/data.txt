## Distribution[edit]

Flowering Siberian fir. Eastern Siberia

The tree lives in the cold boreal climate on moist soils in mountains or river
basins at elevations of 1900-2400 m. It is very shade-tolerant, frost-
resistant, and hardy, surviving temperatures down to -50 ?C. It rarely lives
over 200 years due to the susceptibility to fungal decay in the wood.

## Description[edit]

Siberian fir, Abies sibirica, grows 30-35 m tall with a trunk diameter of
0.5-1 m at breast height and a conical crown. The bark is grey-green to grey-
brown and smooth with resin blisters typical of most firs. Shoots are yellow-
grey, resinous, and slightly pubescent. The leaves are needle-like, 2-3 cm
long and 1.5 mm broad on average. They are light green above with two grey-
white stomatal bands underneath, and are directed upwards along the stem. They
are soft, flattened, and strongly aromatic. The cones are cylindrical, 5-9.5
cm long and 2.5-3.5 cm broad, with small bracts hidden by the scales. They
ripen from bluish to brown or dark brown in mid-autumn. The seeds, 7 mm long
with a triangular wing 0.7-1.3 cm long, are released when the cone
disintegrates after maturity.

### Varieties[edit]

There are two varieties:

  * Abies sibirica var. sibirica. Described above.
  * Abies sibirica var. semenovii (B. Fedtschenko) Farjon. Endemic in Kyrgyzstan. Branchlets noticeably ridged and grooved. Resin canals marginal. Cones yellow-brown, with broader bracts than those of var. sibirica.

## Uses[edit]

Essential oils extracted from the leaves are used in aromatherapy and
perfumes. The wood is soft, lightweight, and weak. It is used in construction,
furniture, and wood pulp.
