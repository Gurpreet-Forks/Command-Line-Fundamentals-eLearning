Abies concolor, the white fir, is a coniferous tree in the pine family
Pinaceae. This tree is native to the mountains of western North America from
the southern Cascade range in Oregon, south throughout California and into the
San Pedro de Matir in northern Baja California; west through parts of southern
Idaho, to Wyoming; and south throughout the Colorado Plateau and southern
Rocky Mountains in Utah and Colorado, and into the isolated mountain ranges of
southern Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico. White fir live over
300-years and naturally occur at an elevation between 900-3,400 m
(2,950-11,200 ft).[4]

It is popular as an ornamental landscaping tree and as a Christmas tree.

The specific epithet concolor means "all one color".[5]

## Description[edit]

### Size[edit]

This large evergreen coniferous tree grows best in the central Sierra Nevada
of California, where the record specimen was recorded as 74.9 m (246 ft) tall
and measured 4.6 m (183 in) in diameter at breast height (dbh) in Yosemite
National Park.[6] The typical size of white fir ranges from 25-60 m (80-195
ft) tall and up to 2.7 m dbh (8.9 ft). The largest specimens are found in the
central Sierra Nevada, where the largest diameter recorded was found in Sierra
National Forest at 58.5 x 8.5 m (192? x 27? 11?) (1972)[7]Rocky mountain white
fir rarely exceed 38 m (125 ft) tall or 0.9 m (3 ft) dbh. Large but not huge
trees, in good soil, range from 40 to 60 m (131 to 195 ft) tall and from 99 to
165 cm (39 to 65 in) dbh in California and southwestern Oregon and to 41 m
(134 ft) tall and 124 cm (49 in) dbh in Arizona and New Mexico.[8]

### Leaves and Cones[edit]

The leaves are needle-like, flattened, 2.5-6 cm (1-2 3/8 in) long and 2 mm
(3/32 in) wide by 0.5-1 mm (1/64-3/64 in) thick, green to glaucous blue-green
above, and with two glaucous blue-white bands of stomatal bloom below, and
slightly notched to bluntly pointed at the tip. The leaf arrangement is spiral
on the shoot, but with each leaf variably twisted at the base so they all lie
in either two more-or-less flat ranks on either side of the shoot, or upswept
across the top of the shoot but not below the shoot.

The cones are 6-12 cm (2 1/4-4 3/4 in) long and 4-4.5 cm (1 5/8-1 3/4 in)
broad, green or purple ripening pale brown, with about 100-150 scales; the
scale bracts are short, and hidden in the closed cone. The winged seeds are
released when the cones disintegrate at maturity about 6 months after
pollination.[9]

## Subspecies[edit]

Foliage and cones of subsp. concolor

As treated here, there are two subspecies; these are also variously treated at
either the lower rank of variety by some authors, or as distinct species by
others:

### Abies concolor subsp. concolor[edit]

  * Abies concolor subsp. concolor -- Colorado white fir or Rocky Mountains white fir. In the United States, at altitudes of 1,700-3,400 m (5,600-11,200 ft) in the Rocky Mountains from southern Idaho, south through Utah and Colorado, to New Mexico and Arizona, and on the higher Great Basin mountains of Nevada and extreme southeastern California, and a short distance into northern Sonora, Mexico. A smaller tree to 25-35 m (80-115 ft) tall, rarely 45 m (150 ft). Foliage strongly upcurved to erect on all except weak shaded shoots in the lower crown; leaves mostly 3.5-6 cm (1 3/8-2 3/8 in), and strongly glaucous on the upper side with numerous stomata. Tolerates winter temperatures down to about -40 ?C (-40 ?F).

### Abies concolor subsp. lowiana[edit]

  * Abies concolor subsp. lowiana (syn. Abies lowiana) -- Low's white fir or Sierra Nevada white fir. In the United States, at altitudes of 900-2,300 m (3,000-7,500 ft)[10] from the Cascades of central Oregon south through California (Klamath Mountains, Sierra Nevada) to northern Baja California, Mexico. A larger tree to 40-60 m (130-195 ft) tall. Foliage flattened on lower crown shoots, the leaves often raised above the shoot on upper crown shoots but not often strongly upcurved; leaves mostly 2.5-5 cm (1-2 in), and only weakly glaucous on the upper side with few or no stomata. Tolerates winter temperatures down to about -30 ?C (-22 ?F). The United States Department of Agriculture plants database describes this subspecies as the full species Sierra white fir \- Abies lowiana (Gordon & Glend.) A. Murray bis.[11]

### Related species[edit]

White fir is very closely related to grand fir (Abies grandis), with
subspecies lowiana being particularly similar to the interior variety of grand
fir A. grandis var. idahoensis, intergrading with it where they meet in the
Cascades of central Oregon. To the south in Mexico, it is replaced by further
close relatives, Durango fir (A. durangensis) and Mexican fir (A. mexicana).

## Forest succession[edit]

White fir is a shade tolerant, climax species, which means the forest has
reached complex maturity in forest succession in western coniferous forests of
the United States. White fir and yellow pine (ponderosa pine/Jeffrey pine)
have co-existed for millennia in old growth forests throughout their range. In
the presence of logging of large diameter trees and exclusion of cleansing
wildfires, young trees have become abundant over the past two centuries.[12]
White fir had been regarded as a pest in the past by those in the lumber
industry, but this opinion has changed. White fir is now one of the most
important of all commercial softwoods according to the Western Wood Products
Association.[13]

The white fir trait of retaining lower limbs creates an escape route for
medium to small forest birds (spotted owl) from larger flying predators and
provides a drip zone around the roots for collecting moisture. The retained
limbs can become a fire ladder that allow flames to climb up to the canopy.
Limbing-up white fir, instead of removing medium to large diameter trees, in
areas where the public is more likely to start fires can help keep other trees
and specifically giant sequoia from experiencing canopy fire. Recent concern
for sequoia groves has caused agencies to call for removal of white fir in the
Sierra Nevada. While sequoia seedlings and young saplings are highly
susceptible to mortality or serious injury by fire; mature sequoias are fire
adapted with: fire resistant bark, elevated canopies, self-pruning lower
branches, latent buds, and serotinous cones. The sequoia ecosystem is
incomplete without the mixed pine/fir and oak that make up the mid and
understory.[14] Giant Sequoia's cones release seeds when the heat of fire
triggers them to open while the thick bark protects the inner cambium from
fire damage.[15]

## Botanical Collection[edit]

White fir was first collected by Augustus Fendler on his expedition to the
Santa Fe area of New Mexico in 1846-1847. Fender's patron George Engelmann, a
St. Louis area physician and botanist, then described the plant.[16] This tree
was first collected in California by William Lobb on his expedition to
California of 1849-1853, after it was overlooked by David Douglas in his
1825-27 expedition to the Pacific coast region.[17][18]

## Ecology[edit]

This tree is host to fir mistletoe (Phoradendron pauciflorum), a parasitic
plant. It is attacked by many types of insects, such as the fir engraver
(Scolytus ventralis).[19]

## Dependent Species[edit]

Mature white fir - yellow pine forest support old-growth dependent wildlife
species such as California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis),
Mount Pinos sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus howardi), and Pacific fisher
(Pekania pennanti). The spotted owl and fisher utilize cavities in decadent
large diameter white fir for nesting and denning.[20] The Mount Pinos sooty
grouse requires large diameter trees for thermal cover and its winter diet
consists of mostly white fir and yellow pine needles. This subspecies of sooty
grouse has been extirpated along with a significant number of large diameter
white fir from much of its range. Other subspecies of sooty grouse also
utilize Douglas fir, which does not occur in the range of Mount Pinos sooty
grouse.[21]

## Uses[edit]

White fir (Abies concolor) essential oil in clear glass vial

White fir is a preferred construction species because of its nail-holding
ability, lightness in weight, and resistance to split, twist, and pitch. It is
straight-grained, non-resinous, fine-textured, stiff, and strong.[22]

White fir is popular as a Christmas tree and for Christmas decoration owing to
its soft needles, generally excellent needle retention and abundance. It is
often marketed as concolor or white fir.[23]

### Cultivation[edit]

White fir is widely planted as an ornamental tree in parks and larger gardens,
particularly some cultivars of subsp. concolor selected for very bright
glaucous blue foliage, such as cv. 'Violacea'. The cultivar 'Compacta' has
gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[24]
