Abies squamata is a species of conifer in the Pinaceae family. This fir is
common in the Southeast of the Tibetan Plateau (China) in an altitude from
3200 m to tree-line in 4400 m. It is dominant on North-facing slopes and often
grows with Balfour's spruce, Picea balfouriana. Government sector logging that
was rampant until the logging ban in 1998 reduced fir stands significantly.
Reforestation after the ban was dominated by spruce, since Abies squamata is
susceptible to stem rot and thus shunned by the state forest bureaus (Ryavec &
Winkler 2009). Undergrowth is most commonly dominated by members of the genus
Rhododendron. Local Tibetans know this fir as "bollo", but that term is a
general term for firs and spruces.
