Abies alba, the European silver fir or silver fir,[3] is a fir native to the
mountains of Europe, from the Pyrenees north to Normandy, east to the Alps and
the Carpathians, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro,
Serbia, and south to Italy, Bulgaria, Albania and northern Greece.[1]

## Description[edit]

Abies alba is a large evergreen coniferous tree growing to 40-50 m (130-160
ft) (exceptionally 60 m (200 ft)) tall and with a trunk diameter up to 1.5 m
(4 ft 11 in). The largest measured tree was 60 m tall and had a trunk diameter
of 3.8 m (12 ft). It occurs at altitudes of 300-1,700 m (980-5,580 ft) (mainly
over 500 m (1,600 ft)), on mountains with rainfall over 1,000 millimetres (39
in) per year.[3]

The leaves are needle-like, flattened, 1.8-3.0 cm (0.71-1.18 in) long and 2.0
mm (0.079 in) wide by 0.5 mm (0.020 in) thick, glossy dark green above, and
with two greenish-white bands of stomata below. The tip of the leaf is usually
slightly notched at the tip. The cones are 9-17 cm (3.5-6.7 in) long and 3-4
cm (1.2-1.6 in) broad, with about 150-200 scales, each scale with an exserted
bract and two winged seeds; they disintegrate when mature to release the
seeds.[citation needed] The wood is white, leading to the species name
alba.[3]

It tends to forms woods with other firs and beeches.[3] It is closely related
to Bulgarian fir (Abies borisiiregis) further to the southeast in the Balkan
Peninsula, Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo) of Spain and Morocco and Sicilian fir
(Abies nebrodensis) in Sicily, differing from these and other related Euro-
Mediterranean firs in the sparser foliage, with the leaves spread either side
of the shoot, leaving the shoot readily visible from above. Some botanists
treat Bulgarian fir and Sicilian fir as varieties of silver fir, as A. alba
var. acutifolia and A. alba var. nebrodensis, respectively.[citation needed]

## Ecology[edit]

Silver fir is an important component species in the dinaric calcareous block
fir forest in the western Balkan Peninsula.[citation needed]

In Italy, the silver fir is an important component of the mixed broadleaved-
coniferous forest of the Apennine Mountains, especially in northern Apennine.
The fir prefer a cold and humid climate, in northern exposition, with a high
rainfall (over 1500 mm per year). In the oriental Alps of Italy, silver firs
grow in mixed forests with Norway spruce, beech, and other trees.

Its cone scales are eaten by the caterpillars of the tortrix moth Cydia
illutana, while C. duplicana feeds on the bark around injuries or
canker.[citation needed]

## Chemistry and pharmacology[edit]

The bark and wood of silver fir are rich in antioxidative polyphenols.[4][5]
Six phenolic acids were identified (gallic, homovanillic, protocatehuic,
p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic and p-coumaric), three flavonoids (catechin,
epicatechin and catechin tetramethyl ether) and eight lignans (taxiresinol,
7-(2-methyl-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydropyran-5-yloxy)-taxiresinol,
secoisolariciresinol, laricinresinol, hydroxymatairesinol, isolariciresinol,
matairesinol and pinoresinol).[6][4] The extract from the trunk was shown to
prevent atherosclerosis in guinea pigs[7] and to have cardioprotective effect
in isolated rat hearts.[8] Silver fir wood extract was found to reduce the
post-prandial glycemic response (concentration of sugar in the blood after the
meal) in healthy volunteers.[9]

## Uses[edit]

A resinous essential oil can be extracted. This pine-scented oil is used in
perfumes, bath products, and aerosol inhalants.[3] Its branches (including the
leaves, bark and wood) were used for production of spruce beer.[10]

Silver fir is the species first used as a Christmas tree, but has been largely
replaced by Nordmann fir (which has denser, more attractive foliage), Norway
spruce (which is much cheaper to grow), and other species.[citation needed]

The wood is strong, lightweight, light-colored, fine grained, even-textured
and long fibered. The timber is mainly used as construction wood, furniture,
plywood, pulpwood and paper manufacture.[11]

## Etymology[edit]

Abies is derived from Latin, meaning 'rising one'. The name was used to refer
to tall trees or ships.[12]

Alba means 'bright' or 'dead white'.[12]
