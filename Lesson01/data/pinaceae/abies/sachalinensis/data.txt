Abies sachalinensis, the Sakhalin fir, is a species of conifer in the family
Pinaceae(pine family). It is found in Sakhalin island and southern Kurils
(Russia), and also in northern Hokkaido (Japan).[2] The first discovery by a
European was by Carl Friedrich Schmidt (1832-1908), the Baltic German
botanist, on the Russian island of Sakhalin in 1866, but he did not introduce
it to Europe. The plant was re-discovered by the English plant-collector,
Charles Maries in 1877 near Aomori on the main Japanese island of Honshu, who
initially thought it to be a variety of Abies veitchii.[3] Abies
nephrolepis(khingan fir) is known to be the closest relative. Which is on the
mainland just west of the range of Sakhalin fir.[4]

## Description[edit]

Grows to 30m tall with Girths up to 100 cm. The crown pyramidal, but tend to
flatten out as they grow to old age. Branches are long and slender during the
life time.[4] As you move down to more northern parts of its habitat they tend
to grow shorter.[5] hardiness zone of 5 (cold limit is between -23.3 Degree C
and -28.8 Degree C)[4]

## Distribution[edit]

Been seen at sea level up to 1,650m in different areas, but on Sakhalin Island
it sits at elevations of 800-1,100m in pure stands or in mixed forests with
Picea jezoensis(Yezo spruce) and Picea glehnii around the treeline. It is also
found in lower elevations with broadleaf trees including Betula
ermanii(Erman's birch), Castanea crenulata, Kalopanax septemlobus(castor
aralia), and Mangnolia hypoleuca.[4]

## Habitat[edit]

Cool summers, mild winters, and precipitation around 1,500mm. Half or more
falls during the winter.[6] soils tend to be well drained and moist.[4] Does
not do well in water logged soil. very shade tolerant when young, growth is
slower in dense shade. It likes slightly acidic soils at a PH of around 5.[7]

## Uses[edit]

Mainly logged for the production of wood pulp for the paper industry. It is a
used for cultivations in gardens and arboreta in Russia, Northern Europe,
England, and USA[1] The Abies Sachalinesis is used for dying/tanning,
Essential oils, Fibers, Timber, and Medicine. It is also made into products
such as Boxes, Crates, Pallets, Posts, Stakes, Fences, wall paneling, and
carpentry (exterior/interior).[8] It is an important plantation species in
Hokkaido, while the other Abies species are not used for plantation[9]

## Barks/needles[edit]

Bark is greyish white, as it grows older the bark starts to get rough to the
touch.[2] Needles cover the shoots above and on the sides similar to the Abies
veitchii, Needle length is .5 to 1.4 inches long (1.2-3.5 cm) and .04 to .05
inches wide (1-1.2mm). Soft in texture with a glossy fresh green color.[2]

## Seedlings/cones[edit]

Seed cones are cylindric, from 2-3.2 inches long, and 1-1.2 inches wide. When
young colors of the cones are brown to dark purple, as they mature they turn
blue-black to black-brown.[5]

## Root system[edit]

Forms surface root systems because of the moist soils. When soils are very
saturated the roots form a well developed tap root[10]

## Threats[edit]

There have been no threats to this species. Old growth stands see the most
pressure from logging in parts outside of Japan[1]
