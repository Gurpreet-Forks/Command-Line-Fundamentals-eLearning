Abies holophylla, also called needle fir[2] or Manchurian fir, is a species of
fir native to mountainous regions of northern Korea, southern Ussuriland, and
China in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning.

It is an evergreen coniferous tree growing to 30 m (100 ft) tall and 1 m (3
ft) in trunk diameter with a narrowly conical crown of horizontal spreading
branches. The bark is scaly and gray-brown with resin blisters. The leaves
("needles") are flattened, 2-4 cm (3/4-1 1/2 in) long and 1.5-2.5 mm
(1/16-3/32 in) thick, spread at right angles from the shoot, and end in a
point.[3]

They spread on two sides, but not flat like for example in silver fir. Usually
they more or less rise up forming with the shoot a V-shape empty compartment
above it. Unlike in silver fir, the leaves here are sharp and prickly, without
any indentation at the top.[4]

They are bright green above and whitish-green below with 2 whitish strips,
each of which is formed by 7-10 wax-covered stomatal bands. The shoots are
glabrous, shiny yellow-gray when young and turning gray-brown. The cones are
12-14 cm (4 3/4-5 1/2 in) long by 4-5 cm (1 1/2-2 in) wide, yellow-brown, and
slightly tapering with a bluntly rounded apex. The scale bracts are hidden
under the cone scales. The seeds, 8-9 mm (5/16-3/8 in) long with a wedge-
shaped wing 1.5 cm (5/8 in) long, are released after the cones disintegrate at
maturity in October.

Manchurian fir is sometimes, but not commonly, used as an ornamental plant.[3]

Unlike in some of other firs, unmature cones here are not purple-bluish, but
green. [4]

cones are raised.
