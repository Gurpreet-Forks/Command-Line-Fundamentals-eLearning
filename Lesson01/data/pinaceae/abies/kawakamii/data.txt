Abies kawakamii is a species of conifer in the Pinaceae family. It is found
only in Taiwan. First described in 1908 by Bunzo Hayata as a variety of Abies
mariesii, a high-mountain fir native to Japan; the next year it was elevated
to species rank by Tokutaro Ito. Abies kawakamii is exclusively native to the
island of Taiwan, and is one of the southernmost true firs (together with A.
fansipanensis, native to Vietnam, and A. guatemalensis, from Mexico and
Guatemala). It is a high-mountain species occurring in northern and central
Taiwan at elevations between 2400 and 3800 m in association with other
temperate plants, dominantly conifers, including Juniperus formosana var.
formosana, Tsuga formosana, and Juniperus morrisonicola.[2]

Taiwan fir is a small to medium-sized tree sometimes reaching a height of 35 m
and trunk diameter of 1 m. Initially, the bark is scurfy or scaly,
lenticellate, later detaching in elongated plates. The branchlets are
yellowish-brown when mature, furrowed, hairy. The needles are 1-2.8 cm long,
pruinose, with stoma-lines above and 2 stomatal bands below. It has rather
small cones 5-7.5 cm long, cylindrical or conical-cylindrical, dark blue, with
included bracts.[2]
