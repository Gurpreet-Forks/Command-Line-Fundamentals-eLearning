Veitch's fir (Abies veitchii; ???? or ??? shirabiso or shirabe), also known as
Veitch's silver-fir,[1] is a fir native to Japan on the islands of Honshu and
Shikoku. It lives in moist soils in cool wet mountain forests at elevations of
1500-2800 m. It is very shade-tolerant when young, but is not long-lived.

It is a coniferous evergreen tree growing at a fast rate to 25-30 m tall. The
crown is narrowly conical with horizontal branches and pubescent shoots. The
shoots are pubescent, with short brown hairs. The leaves are needle-like and
flattened, 1-3 cm long and 2 mm broad. They are glossy dark green above with
two conspicuous bluish white stomatal bands underneath, and the tips are
notched. The foliage is dense and points forward along the shoot, with the
inner leaves being shorter and more erect than the lower leaves. The cone is
purple-brown, cylindrical, 4-7 cm long and tapers slightly. The cones are
upright and have slightly exserted and reflexed yellow-green bracts. The bark
is smooth and light grey, and has resin blisters characteristic of many firs.

There are two varieties:

  * Abies veitchii var. veitchii. Endemic to Honshu; Shoots densely pubescent. Leaves 1.5-3 cm long; stomatal bands bluish white.
  * Abies veitchii var. sikokiana (Nakai) Kusaka. Endemic to Shikoku; NT. Shoots thinly pubescent. Leaves 1-2 cm long; stomatal bands white. In many respects intermediate between var. veitchii and Abies koreana, it has been treated as a distinct species Abies sikokiana by some authors.

The wood is sturdy and elastic, and is used in construction, boxes, utensils,
and spindles. Veitch's fir is a popular ornamental tree and is occasionally
grown for Christmas trees.
