Abies pinsapo (Spanish fir) is a species of fir native to southern Spain and
northern Morocco.[1] Related to other species of Mediterranean firs, it is
considered the Andalusian National Tree. In Spain, it appears at altitudes of
900-1,800 metres (3,000-5,900 ft) in the Sierra de Grazalema in the province
of Cadiz and the Sierra de las Nieves and Sierra Bermeja, both near Ronda in
the province of Malaga. In Morocco, it is limited to the Rif Mountains at
altitudes of 1,400-2,100 metres (4,600-6,900 ft) on Jebel Tissouka and Jebel
Tazaot.

## Description[edit]

Abies pinsapo is an evergreen tree growing to 20-30 m tall, with a conic
crown, sometimes becoming irregular with age. The leaves are 1.5-2 cm long,
arranged radially all round the shoots, and are strongly glaucous pale blue-
green, with broad bands of whitish wax on both sides. The cones are
cylindrical, 9-18 cm long, greenish-pink to purple before maturity, and smooth
with the bract scales short and not exserted. When mature, they disintegrate
to release the winged seeds.

The Moroccan variety, Abies pinsapo var. marocana or the Moroccan fir, differs
in the leaves being less strongly glaucous and the cones slightly longer,
11-20 cm long.

The cultivars A. pinsapo 'Aurea'[2] (to 8m, with golden new growth) and A.
pinsapo 'Glauca'[3] (to 12m plus, with grey-green leaves) have gained the
Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

## Conservation[edit]

Spanish fir, despite the best conservation and reforestation efforts that have
greatly increased its abundance, still has several threats such as fires,
urban projects, erosion, excessive visitors and tourists, etc.
