Abies delavayi, the Delavay's silver-fir[2] or Delavay's fir, is a species of
fir, native to Yunnan in southwest China and adjoining border areas in
southeastern Tibet, far northeastern India, northern Myanmar, and far
northwestern Vietnam. It is a high altitude mountain tree, growing at
elevations of 3,000-4,000 m (exceptionally down to 2,400 m and up to 4,300 m),
often occupying the tree line.[3]

The species is named after its discoverer, Father Pierre Jean Marie Delavay,
who collected it at 3,500-4,000 m on the Cang Mountain near Dali.[4]

It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 7-40 m tall, often
less at tree line. The shoots are purple-brown to dark red-brown, glabrous or
finely pubescent. The leaves are needle-like, 15-30 mm long and 1-2 mm broad,
with a distinctive revolute margin. The upper surface of the leaves is glossy
dark green with no stomata, the underside vivid snow-white with the stomata
densely covered in white wax; this is thought to be an adaptation to exclude
very heavy rain in its monsoon climate.[5] The cones are dark purple-blue,
6-12 cm long and 3-4.5 cm broad, with numerous small scales and exserted
bracts; they break up when mature at 6-8 months old to release the winged
seeds.

Trees at lower elevation (2,400-3,000 m) differ in having the leaf margin less
revolute, and are separated as a variety Abies delavayi var. nukiangensis
(Cheng & Fu) Farjon.[3]

Plants in southeastern Tibet have been distinguished as Abies delavayi var.
motuoensis Cheng & Fu, differing in paler, densely pubescent shoots.[3]

The Vietnamese population, with a disjunct range on Fansipan (at 3,143 m the
highest mountain in Vietnam), is distinct in paler red-brown shoots and the
cones having shorter bracts (not exserted), and is separated as a subspecies
Abies delavayi subsp. fansipanensis (Q.P.Xiang) Rushforth (syn. Abies
fansipanensis Q.P.Xiang).[6]

Delavay's fir is occasionally grown as an ornamental tree, but its successful
cultivation is limited to regions with cool summers and high rainfall, such as
western Scotland and the Pacific coast of Canada. A semi-dwarf form
originating at very high altitude has been selected as a cultivar 'Major
Neishe', growing to 3-4 m tall.[7]
