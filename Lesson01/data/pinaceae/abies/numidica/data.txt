## Description[edit]

Abies numidica is a medium-sized to large evergreen tree growing to 20-35
meters tall, with a trunk up to 1 meter diameter. The leaves are needle-like,
moderately flattened, 1.5-2.5 centimeters long and 2-3 millimeters wide by 1
millimeters thick, glossy dark green with a patch of greenish-white stomata
near the tip above, and with two greenish-white bands of stomata below. The
tip of the leaf is variable, usually pointed, but sometimes slightly notched
at the tip, particularly on slow-growing shoots on older trees. The cones are
glaucous green with a pink or violet tinge, maturing brown, 10-20 centimeters
long and 4 centimeters broad, with about 150-200 scales, each scale with a
short bract (not visible on the closed cone) and two winged seeds; they
disintegrate when mature to release the seeds.[2]

## Distribution[edit]

Abies numidica grows in a high-altitude Mediterranean climate at 1,800-2,004
meters (and rarely down to 1,220 meters) with an annual precipitation of
1,500-2,000 milliliters, the great majority of which falls as winter snow; the
summers are warm and very dry. It is closely related to Abies pinsapo (Spanish
fir), which occurs further west in the Rif mountains of Morocco and in
southern Spain.[2]

## Cultivation and uses[edit]

Algerian fir, Abies numidica, is occasionally grown as an ornamental tree in
parks and larger gardens. It is valued among firs for its drought tolerance.
