## Characteristics[edit]

Dacrycarpus steupii can grow up to the average height of about 35 m, but it is
common to see them stunted in growth. The outer bark is black to dark brown
while the inner bark is reddish brown to pink. The bark also peels of in small
flakes. The male flowers cannot be seen. Female cones can be found on long,
elongate leaves. The needles on the branches are widespread.[2]

## Location and range[edit]

It is found only in Indonesia. In Kalimantan, Dacrycarpus steupii was known
from a population near Balikpapan that is now extinct. It is possible that it
is widespread through New Guinea in the Latimodjong Mountains.[1]

## Population[edit]

It is threatened by habitat loss and modern agricultural growth.[1]
