## Description[edit]

Nageia nagi pollen cones

Nageia nagi seed cones

Nageia nagi is a hardy tree species that can withstand a range of weather
conditions, but it prefers moist sites that are well drained and with full
sunlight to light shade. Being from the Podocarpaceae family, it is a
dioecious tree, that is, the male and female parts of the trees are on
separate plants.[2] The pollen cones are catkins and the female cones, which
mature in one year, are reduced fleshy bracts that contain a single inverted
ovule. It requires wind for pollination; it cannot self-pollinate.[3]

The trees range from fifteen to twenty meters in height and are relatively
slow growing.[4] The leaves are lanceolate in shape, and are arranged sub
opposite on the branches. Leaves range from two to eight inches long and 0.75
to 2.5 inches wide and lack a mid-vein. The new leaves are a light green and
as they age they become dark green and glossy. The branches also start out as
green but as they age they become reddish brown and peel in small layers.[2]

Nageia nagi can be propagated by cuttings or by seed. It is best to plant the
seed in a warm greenhouse and sandy soil. For their permanent position, they
should be planted in late spring or early summer after the last frost.[5]

The species is threatened by habitat loss.

## Uses[edit]

Houses, bridges, utensils, handiwork and furniture are constructed from the
wood. The seeds yield an oil that is edible and valued in industry.[6] Young
leaves are sometimes cooked and eaten.[5] Its bark exhibits strong
antibacterial effect.[7]
