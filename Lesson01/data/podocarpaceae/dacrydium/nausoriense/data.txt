Dacrydium nausoriense is a species of conifer in the family Podocarpaceae. It
is endemic to Fiji, where it is only known from one subpopulation on each of
the two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. It is a valuable timber tree
which has been overharvested. This overexploitation and habitat loss are the
main threats to this endangered species.[1]
