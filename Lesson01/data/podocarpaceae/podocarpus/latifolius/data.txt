## Appearance[edit]

Detail of the characteristic foliage of the real yellowwood

The real yellowwood is a large evergreen tree that grows up to 30 meters in
height. It grows relatively slowly but forms a wood of exceptional quality.

The leaves are strap-shaped, 25-40 mm long on mature trees, larger, to 100 mm
long, on vigorous young trees, and 6-12 mm broad, with a bluntly pointed tip.
The species name "latifolius" actually means "wide-leaved". The bright-
coloured foliage of new growth stands out against the dark leaves of mature
foliage.

The cones of this dioecious tree are berry-like, with a single (rarely two)
7-11 mm seed apical on an 8-14 mm pink-purple aril; the aril is edible and
sweet. The male (pollen) cones are 10-30 mm long.

## Distribution[edit]

It is native to the moister southern and eastern areas of South Africa, from
coastal areas of the Western Cape east to KwaZulu-Natal and north to eastern
Limpopo. Pockets are naturally found further north in and around Zimbabwe.

It is commonly found in afro-temperate forests and often in mountainous areas.
In harsh or exposed areas it tends to become stunted, small and dense.

## Human usage[edit]

A young specimen growing on the slopes of Table Mountain

It is a slow-growing tree but exceptionally long-lived, and is increasingly
grown as an ornamental feature in South African gardens. The unusual texture
of the foliage is a reason for its growing popularity. The bright edible
berries attract birds, which spread the seed.

The wood is hard, similar to yew wood, used for furniture, panelling, etc. Due
to past over-exploitation, little is now cut.
