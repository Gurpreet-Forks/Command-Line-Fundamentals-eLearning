## Description[edit]

The plant is usually a shrub, not often forming a single trunk, instead
growing multiple branches from around the base. It looks like a conifer,
typically grows to a height of 0.75 to 3 metres (2 to 10 ft)[2] and forms
clumps a few metres wide.[1] It is dioecious[2] and very slow-growing. The
bark is thin and fibrous, green in colour turning red-brown on the outside.
The leaves are needle-like, 4 to 8 centimetres (1.6 to 3.1 in) long, sharply
pointed, green above and with glaucous stomatal bands beneath. The cones are
berry-like, with a fleshy, edible purple aril 2 to 2.5 cm (0.79 to 0.98 in)
long and one (rarely two) apical seeds 1 cm (0.39 in)1 cm long.

## Distribution[edit]

It grows on lower slopes and low-lying areas and around creeks in the South
West and Great Southern regions of Western Australia where it grows in loamy,
sandy or gravelly soils.[2] It is associated as part of the understorey
species present in lowland jarrah and karri and it spreads mostly by root
suckering.[1] The extent of occurrence of the species is less than 20,000
square kilometres (7,722 sq mi) over multiple locations. The total area of
occupancy by P. drouynianus has reduced as a result of clearing of forest for
pasture and the replacement of native forest with exotics.[4]

## Cultivation[edit]

Ideally Podocarpus drouynianus should be grown in partial shade with plenty of
water. Unusually for the genus, it tolerates quite dry conditions. It survives
temperatures of up to 45 ?C, and grows well in full sun or partial shade.

## Classification[edit]

The species was initially described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in
1864 in his work Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. There are two synonyms
for this species: Nageia drouyniana and Podocarpus drouyniana.[5] The species
name honors the statesman Edouard Drouyn de Lhuys who was a member of the
Institut de France.[1]
