## Description[edit]

Podocarpus aristulatus grows to 10-20 m tall. The leaves are elliptical to
linear, 2-4 cm long and 5-8 mm broad, arranged spirally on the shoots. The
seed cones are berry-like, with fleshy red receptacle and one (occasionally
two) apical seeds 7-10 mm long.

## Uses[edit]

In the mountainous regions of the central Dominican Republic, where it is
known as Palo de Cruz (or wood of the cross) it is used for axe handles and
pestles, because of the durable quality of the wood. Its leaves are used for
medicinal teas.[citation needed] As part of the religious beliefs of the area,
small pieces are placed above the door frame on the inside of houses as a way
of warding off evil spirits.
