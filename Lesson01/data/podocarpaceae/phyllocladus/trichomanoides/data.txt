Phyllocladus trichomanoides, the tanekaha, is a coniferous tree native to New
Zealand.

Tanekaha is a medium-sized forest tree growing up to 20 m in height and 1 m
trunk diameter. The main structural shoots are green for 2-3 years, then turn
brown as the bark thickens. The leaves are sparse, tiny, scale-like, 2-3 mm
long, and only green (photosynthetic) for a short time, soon turning brown.

Most photosynthesis is performed by highly modified, leaf-like short shoots
called phylloclades; these are arranged alternately, 10-15 on a shoot, the
individual phylloclades rhombic, 1.5-2.5 cm long. The seed cones are berry-
like, with a fleshy white aril surrounding but not fully enclosing the single
seed.

## Economic uses[edit]

Like the kauri, tanekaha shed their lower branches, producing smooth straight
trunks and knot-free timber which is sought after for its strength.

The bark is rich in tannin, from which Maori extracted a red dye.
