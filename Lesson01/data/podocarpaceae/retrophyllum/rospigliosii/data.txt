## Etymology and names[edit]

The specific epithet rospigliosii honors C. J. Rospigliosi of the Museum of
Natural History in Lima, Peru.[2]

The species has multiple common names in the Spanish language. These include
pino hayuelo, pino laso, pino de montana, pino romeron and romerillo macho.[2]

## Description[edit]

Leaves showing the pectinate arrangement.

Retrophyllum rospigliosii is an evergreen tree growing up to 45 meters in
height and 1,8 meters in trunk diameter.[2] The trunk is usually erect and
straight. The crown typically becomes rounded or oval in shape as the tree
matures.[2][3] Branches are generally ascending or spreading, but become
pendulous on shaded parts of the crown.[2] The bark is initially brown and
weathers dark gray, exfoliating in scale-like flakes.[2][3]

The leaves are generally flattened with a decurrent base and a spreading
blade, but leading shoots may also have appressed scale-like leaves.[2] The
leaves are inserted spirally but are twisted on lateral branchlets to appear
pectinate and nearly opposite.[2] The pectinate leaves are twisted at their
petioles in opposite directions on each side of the shoot causing the adaxial
sides of the leaves face up on one side of the shoot and down on the other
side. The leaf blades are most commonly 10-18 millimeters long and 3-5
millimeters wide.[2] They are ovate-lanceolate or ovate-elliptic in shape with
visible midribs and entire margins.[2][3] Stomata can be found on both
surfaces of the leaf.[2]

The species is dioecious. The male pollen cones are 5-7 millimeters long with
spirally arranged triangular sporophylls. The female seed cones each have a
single subterminal fertile cone scale with a single ovule developing into a
seed. The seed is covered by a fleshy epimatium. The initially green or
glaucous epimatium becomes red at maturity and varies from subglobose to
ovoid-pyriform in shape with a length of 18-25 millimeters. [2]

## Distribution[edit]

Retrophyllum rospigliosii is native to northwestern South America. It occurs
naturally in Bolivia,[4] Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.[2][3]

## Habitat and ecology[edit]

Pendulous branchlets.

Retrophyllum rospigliosii is a large rainforest tree. It occurs in montane
tropical rainforests and cloud forests at altitudes between 1500 and 3750
meters above the sea level.[2] Most commonly the species grows scattered among
other trees, most of which are angiosperms, but on certain sites it may also
form pure stands.[5]
