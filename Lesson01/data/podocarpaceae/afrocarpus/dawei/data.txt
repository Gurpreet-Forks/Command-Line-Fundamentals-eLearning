Afrocarpus dawei is a species of conifer in the family Podocarpaceae. It is
native to Africa, where it occurs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Tanzania, and Uganda.[1]

This species is a tree that grows in swampy forest habitat that is flooded in
the rainy season. It is associated with Baikiaea minor and Mimusops
species.[1]

This tree is valuable as timber because it grows a long trunk without many
branches. It is likely overharvested, one reason that it is considered to be a
near-threatened species.[1]
