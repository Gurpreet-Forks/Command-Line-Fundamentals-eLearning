Cunninghamia is a genus of one[2] or two living species of evergreen
coniferous trees in the cypress family Cupressaceae.[3] They are native to
China, northern Vietnam and Laos, and perhaps also Cambodia.[2] They may reach
50 m (160 ft) in height.[2] In vernacular use, it is most often known as
Cunninghamia, but is also sometimes called "China-fir" (though it is not a
fir). The genus name Cunninghamia honours Dr. James Cunningham, a British
doctor who introduced this species into cultivation in 1702 and botanist Allan
Cunningham.[4]

## Taxonomy[edit]

The genus is traditionally said to contain two similar species, Cunninghamia
lanceolata and C. konishii, often referred to as the China fir and Taiwan fir,
respectively. C. lanceolata occurs in mainland China, Vietnam, and Laos,
whereas C. konishii is restricted to Taiwan.[5] However, molecular genetic
evidence is suggesting that they are the same species, and that C. konishii of
Taiwan derive from multiple colonizations from the mainland.[6][7] As C.
lanceolata was the first name published, this name takes priority if the two
are combined. In that case, Taiwan fir becomes Cunninghamia lanceolata var.
konishii. However, there is no consensus yet as to whether the two species
should be combined.[5]

In the past, the genus was usually treated in the family Taxodiaceae,[2] but
this family is now included within the Cupressaceae.[3] A few botanists have
also treated it in a family of its own, Cunninghamiaceae, but this is not
widely followed. In the fossil record, Cunninghamia is also known from
America.[8]

## Description[edit]

The general shape of the tree is conical with tiered, horizontal branches that
are often somewhat pendulous toward the tips. Cunninghamia bears softly
spined, leathery, stiff, green to blue-green needle-like leaves that spiral
around the stem with an upward arch; they are 2-7 cm long and 3-5 mm broad at
the base, and bear two white or greenish-white stomatal bands underneath and
sometimes also above. The foliage may turn bronze-tinted in very cold winter
weather.

The cones are small and inconspicuous at pollination in late winter, the
pollen cones in clusters of 10-30 together, the female cones singly or 2-3
together.

The seed cones mature in 7-8 months to 2.5-4.5 cm long, ovoid to globose, with
spirally arranged scales; each scale bears 3-5 seeds. They are often
proliferous (with a vegetative shoot growing on beyond the tip of the cone) on
cultivated trees; this is rare in wild trees, and may be a cultivar selected
for easy vegetative propagation for use in forestry plantations.

As the tree grows its trunk tends to sucker around the base, particularly
following damage to the stem or roots, and it then may grow in a multi-trunked
form. Brown bark of mature trees peels off in strips to reveal reddish-brown
inner bark. Older specimens often look ragged, as the old needles may cling to
stems for up to 5 years.

This tree can be mistaken for the rare Torreya taxifolia, one visible
difference being the Cunninghamia's bronze autumn branches which are shed and
pile beneath it, as well as the propensity for this tree to have more than one
trunk. The Torreya is known as "Florida's gopher wood," as well as "stinking
cedar" and the crushed leaves some say smell like tomato, whereas the
Cunninghamia leaves do not smell.

## Usage[edit]

Cunninghamia is a prized timber tree in China, producing soft, highly durable
scented wood similar to that of Coast Redwood and Sugi. It is used in
particular for manufacture of coffins and in temple building where the scent
is valued.

Cunninghamia is grown as an ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, where
it typically reaches a height of 15-30 m.
