Athrotaxis laxifolia is a species of Athrotaxis, endemic to Tasmania in
Australia, where it grows at 1,000-1,200 m altitude.[2][1]

It is an evergreen coniferous tree growing to 10-20 m tall, with a trunk up to
1 m diameter. The leaves are scale-like, 4-12 mm long and 2-3 mm broad,
arranged spirally on the shoots. The seed cones are oblong-globose, 15-26 mm
long and 14-20 mm diameter, with 14-18 spirally-arranged scales; they are
mature about six months after pollination. The pollen cones are 3-5 mm
long.[2]

Its status in the wild is little-known; it is the rarest of the three species
of Athrotaxis. It is in many respects intermediate between Athrotaxis
cupressoides and Athrotaxis selaginoides, and it is strongly suspected of
being a natural hybrid between these two; however, genetic evidence for this
is inconclusive.[2]

Away from its native range, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental
tree in northwestern Europe. Despite being the rarest of the three in the
wild, it is the most frequently planted Athrotaxis in cultivation, though
still only seen in major collections; trees in Ireland have reached 20 m
tall.[3][4]
