Athrotaxis selaginoides is a species of Athrotaxis, endemic to Tasmania in
Australia, where it grows at 400-1,120 m altitude. In its habitat in the
mountains, snow in winter is very usual. It is often called King Billy Pine or
King William Pine (believed to be in reference to the Tasmanian aborigine
William Lanne),[2] although it is not a true pine.[3][1]

It is an evergreen coniferous tree growing to 20-30 m tall, with a trunk up to
1.5 m diameter. The leaves are claw-like, 7-18 mm long and 3-4 mm broad,
arranged spirally on the shoots. The seed cones are globose, 15-30 mm
diameter, with 20-30 spirally-arranged scales; they are mature about six
months after pollination. The pollen cones are 4-5 mm long.[3]

The main cause of past decline has been fire, with about one third of its
habitat burnt in the twentieth century. Like the other two Athrotaxis species,
A. selaginoides is sensitive to fire. Another cause of past decline has been
logging. The overall decline is estimated to be about 40% over the last 200
years. This is within the three generation time limit where one generation is
estimated to be at least 100 years. Although 84% of forests are now in
protected areas, fires still are a potential hazard. Tasmanian Government
policy precludes logging of this species in and outside these protected
areas.[4]

Away from its native range, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental
tree in northwestern Europe.[5] It succeeds in Scotland where it receives the
necessary rainfalls for its good growth[6] and produces fertile seeds
there.[7]
