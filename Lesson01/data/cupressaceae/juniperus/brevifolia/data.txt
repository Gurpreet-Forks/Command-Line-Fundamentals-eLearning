Juniperus brevifolia, the Azores juniper, is a species of juniper, endemic to
the Azores (on Flores, Corvo, Faial, Flores, Pico, Santa Maria, Sao Jorge, Sao
Miguel, and Terceira), where it occurs at altitudes of 240-800 m, rarely up to
1,500 m. It is closely related to Juniperus oxycedrus (Prickly Juniper) of the
Mediterranean region and Juniperus cedrus (Canary Islands Juniper) of the
Canary Islands. It is threatened by habitat loss.[2][3][1]

It is a shrub or small tree growing to a height of 6 m and a trunk diameter up
to 50 cm. The leaves are evergreen, needle-like, in whorls of three, glaucous
green, 4-10 mm long and 1-3 mm broad, with a double white stomatal band (split
by a green midrib) on the inner surface. It is dioecious, with separate male
and female plants. The seed cones are berry-like, green ripening in 18 months
to orange-red with a variable pink waxy coating; they are spherical, 6-9 mm
diameter, and have three or six fused scales in one or two whorls of three,
the three larger scales each with a single seed. The seeds are dispersed when
birds eat the cones, digesting the fleshy scales and passing the hard seeds in
their droppings. The male cones are yellow, 2-3 mm long, and fall soon after
shedding their pollen in early spring.[2][3]

This is a vulnerable species in its native range due to a combination of
historical felling for the valuable wood and competition from invasive
introduced plants.[1]
