Juniperus communis, the common juniper, is a species of conifer in the genus
Juniperus, in the family Cupressaceae. It has the largest geographical range
of any woody plant, with a circumpolar distribution throughout the cool
temperate Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic south in mountains to around
30?N latitude in North America, Europe and Asia. Relict populations can be
found in the Atlas Mountains of Africa.

## Description[edit]

Prostrate specimens of Juniperus communis subsp. alpina, in Vitosha, Bulgaria

Juniperus communis is a small coniferous evergreen tree or shrub, very
variable in form, ranging from 10 m (33 ft)--rarely 16 m (52 ft)--tall to a low,
often prostrate spreading shrub in exposed locations. It has needle-like
leaves in whorls of three; the leaves are green, with a single white stomatal
band on the inner surface. It never attains adult foliage.[2]:55 It is
dioecious, with male and female cones, which are wind pollinated, on separate
plants.

The fruit are berry-like cones, initially green, ripening in 18 months to
purple-black with a blue waxy coating; they are spherical, 4-12 mm (0.16-0.47
in) diameter, and usually have three (occasionally six) fleshy fused scales,
each scale with a single seed. The seeds are dispersed when birds eat the
cones, digesting the fleshy scales and passing the hard, unwinged seeds in
their droppings. The male cones are yellow, 2-3 mm (0.079-0.118 in) long, and
fall soon after shedding their pollen in March-April.[3][4][5]

### Subspecies[edit]

As to be expected from the wide range, J. communis is very variable, with
several infraspecific taxa; delimitation between the taxa is still uncertain,
with genetic data not matching morphological data
well.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]

  * subsp. communis - Common juniper. Usually an erect shrub or small tree; leaves long, 8-20(-27) mm; cones small, 5-8 mm, usually shorter than the leaves; found at low to moderate altitude in temperate climates. 
    * subsp. communis var. communis - Europe, most of northern Asia
    * subsp. communis var. depressa Pursh - North America, Sierra Nevada in California
    * subsp. communis var. hemisphaerica (J.Presl & C.Presl) Parl. - Mediterranean mountains
    * subsp. communis var. nipponica (Maxim.) E.H.Wilson - Japan (status uncertain, often treated as J. rigida var. nipponica)
  * subsp. alpina (Suter) Celak. - alpine juniper (syn. J. c. subsp. nana, J. c. var. saxatilis Pallas, J. sibirica Burgsd.). Usually a prostrate ground-hugging shrub; leaves short, 3-8 mm; cones often larger, 7-12 mm, usually longer than the leaves; found in subarctic areas and high altitude alpine zones in temperate areas. 
    * subsp. alpina var. alpina - Greenland, Europe and Asia
    * subsp. alpina var. megistocarpa Fernald & H.St.John - Eastern Canada (doubtfully distinct from var. alpina)
    * subsp. alpina var. jackii Rehder - Western North America (doubtfully distinct from var. alpina)

Some botanists treat subsp. alpina at the lower rank of variety, in which case
the correct name is Juniperus communis var. saxatilis Pallas,[4] though the
name Juniperus communis var. montana is also occasionally cited; others,
primarily in eastern Europe and Russia, sometimes treat it as a distinct
species J. sibirica Burgsd. (syn. J. nana Willd., J. alpina S.F.Gray).[11]

Juniperus communis is one of Ireland's longest established plants.[12]

## Chemistry[edit]

The juniper berry oil is composed largely of monoterpene hydrocarbons such as
?-pinene, myrcene, sabinene, limonene and ?-pinene.[13]

## Uses[edit]

Foliage and berries

### Cultivation[edit]

Juniperus communis is cultivated in the horticulture trade and used as an
evergreen ornamental shrub in gardens. The following cultivars gained the
Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit in 1993:[14]

  * Juniperus communis 'Compressa'[15]
  * Juniperus communis 'Green Carpet'[16] (prostrate shrub)
  * Juniperus communis 'Hibernica' (Irish juniper)[17]
  * Juniperus communis 'Repanda'[18] (prostrate shrub)

Juniperus communis wood pieces, with a U.S. penny for scale, showing the
narrow growth rings of the species.

It is too small to have any general lumber usage. In Scandinavia, however,
juniper wood is used for making containers for storing small quantities of
dairy products such as butter and cheese, and also for making wooden butter
knives. It was also frequently used for trenails in wooden shipbuilding by
shipwrights for its tough properties.

In Estonia juniper wood is valued for its long lasting and pleasant aroma,
very decorative natural structure of wood (growth rings) as well as good
physical properties of wood due to slow growth rate of juniper and resulting
dense and strong wood. Various decorative items (often eating utensils) are
common in most Estonian handicraft shops and households.

According to the old tradition, on Easter Monday Kashubian (Northern Poland)
boys chase girls whipping their legs gently with juniper twigs. This is to
bring good fortune in love to the chased girls.

### Culinary[edit]

Its astringent blue-black seed cones, commonly known as "juniper berries", are
too bitter to eat raw and are usually sold dried and used to flavour meats,
sauces, and stuffings. They are generally crushed before use to release their
flavour. Since juniper berries have a strong taste, they should be used
sparingly. They are generally used to enhance meat with a strong flavour, such
as game, including game birds, or tongue.

The cones are used to flavour certain beers and gin (the word "gin" derives
from an Old French word meaning "juniper").[19] In Finland, juniper is used as
a key ingredient in making sahti, a traditional Finnish ale. Also the Slovak
alcoholic beverage Borovicka and Dutch Genever are flavoured with juniper
berry or its extract.

Juniper is used in the traditional farmhouse ales of Norway,[20] Sweden,[21]
Finland,[22] Estonia, and Latvia. In Norway, the beer is brewed with juniper
infusion instead of water, while in the other countries the juniper twigs are
mainly used in the mash, as filters to prevent the crushed malts from clogging
the outlet of the mashing tun. The use of juniper in farmhouse brewing has
been common in much of northern Europe, seemingly for a very long time[23].

### Traditional medicine[edit]

Juniper berries have long been used as medicine by many cultures including the
Navajo people.[24] Western American tribes combined the berries of Juniperus
communis with Berberis root bark in a herbal tea. Native Americans also used
juniper berries as a female contraceptive.[25]

## Gallery[edit]

  * As the cones need more than a year to become ripe, both ripe and unripe cones can be seen together, as on this tree on Saaremaa, Estonia
