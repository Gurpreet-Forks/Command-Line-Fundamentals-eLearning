Juniperus maritima is a species of juniper known by the common name seaside
juniper. It is native to the Puget Sound region in southwestern British
Columbia and northwestern Washington, where it is not uncommon, as well as on
dry mountain ridges on the Olympic Peninsula.[1] It was previously included in
the description of the Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum) but was
separated in 2007.[2] Genetic analysis revealed that what appeared to be Rocky
Mountain junipers in the Puget Sound were not of the same species as those
elsewhere.[2] The Puget Sound species also differs in morphology, with faster-
maturing cones that have protruding seeds, and other differences.[2] It is
especially unique in habitat. The seaside juniper occurs at the edge of the
water, next to the sound or the nearby lakes, in a milder, wetter climate on
sandy, granite soils, even sand dunes in one location.[2] P. scopulorum grows
in drier, rockier substrates in colder locations higher in the mountains.[2]
It is also noted that seaside juniper reproduces itself and does not
interbreed with other junipers, further evidence that it should be called a
separate species.[2]

In general the seaside juniper is common to abundant in its native range;
however, it is impacted by development at some sites and it can face
competition from Douglas-fir.[3]
