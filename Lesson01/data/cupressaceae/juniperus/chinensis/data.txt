## Growth[edit]

It is a coniferous evergreen shrub. The leaves grow in two forms, juvenile
needle-like leaves 5-10 mm long, and adult scale-leaves 1.5-3 mm long. Mature
trees usually continue to bear some juvenile foliage as well as adult,
particularly on shaded shoots low in the crown. This largely species often has
dioecious either male and female plants, but some individual plants produce
both sexes of flowers. The blue-black berry-like cones grow to 7-12 mm in
diameter, have a whitish waxy bloom, and contain 2-4 seeds; they mature in
about 18 months. The male cones, 2-4 mm long, shed their pollen in early
spring.

## Cultivation and uses[edit]

This popular ornamental tree or shrub in gardens, parks, and in tough coastal
conditions of hot sun and sandy fast draining soils, has more than 100 named
cultivars selected for various characters, such as yellow foliage (e.g. cvs.
'Aurea', 'Tremonia'), permanently juvenile foliage (e.g. cv. 'Shoosmith'),
columnar crown shape (cv. 'Columnaris'), abundant cones (e.g. cv. 'Kaizuka'),
etc. First popular in the United States in the Los Angeles gardens in
Mediterranean style homes, and now commonly found along both the West and East
Coast in beach and coastal areas.

The cultivar 'Shimpaku' is a very important bonsai subject. The Chinese
juniper is widely used in bonsai, both as individual plants, such as the
250-year-old "Omiya tree" in the Birmingham Botanical Gardens in the UK, and
in groups, such as the well-known Goshin on display at the National Bonsai and
Penjing Museum at the US National Arboretum.

The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of
Garden Merit:-[1]

  * 'Aurea' (Golden Chinese juniper)[2]
  * 'Blaauw'[3]
  * 'Grey Owl'[4]

  * 'Kaizuka'[5]
  * 'Plumosa Aurea'[6]
  * 'Pyramidalis'[7]

  
  
The hybrid between Juniperus chinensis and Juniperus sabina, known as
Juniperus x pfitzeriana (Pfitzer Juniper, synonym J. x media), is also very
common as a cultivated plant. This hybrid grows only as a shrub, never a tree,
making it suitable for smaller gardens:-

  * J. x pfitzeriana 'Old Gold'[8]
  * J. x pfitzeriana 'Sulphur Spray'[9]

  *   * As a 250 year old bonsai in the Birmingham Botanical Gardens

  *   * J. x pfitzeriana 'Old Gold' 

  * J. chinensis 'Expansa Variegata'
