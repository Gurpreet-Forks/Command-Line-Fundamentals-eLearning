Juniperus rigida, the temple juniper, is a species of juniper, native to
northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far southeast of Russia (Sakhalin and
Primorsky Krai), occurring at altitudes of 10-2,200 m. The species is also
naturalized in California and Alabama. It is closely related to Juniperus
communis (Common Juniper) and Juniperus conferta (Shore Juniper), the latter
sometimes treated as a variety or subspecies of J. rigida.[2][3]

Tree

It is a shrub or small tree growing to a height of 6-10 m and a trunk diameter
up to 50 cm. The leaves are evergreen, needle-like, in whorls of three, bright
green to yellowish-green, 10-23 mm long and 1-1.3 mm broad, with a single
white stomatal band on the inner surface. It is dioecious, with separate male
and female plants. The seed cones are berry-like, green ripening in 18 months
to dark purple or brownish with a variable whitish waxy coating; they are
spherical, 5-9 mm diameter, and have three (rarely six) fused scales in one
(rarely two) whorls of three, each with a single seed (when six scales, only
the three larger scales with seeds). The seeds are dispersed when birds eat
the cones, digesting the fleshy scales and passing the hard seeds in their
droppings. The pollen cones are yellow, 3-5 mm long, and fall soon after
shedding their pollen in spring.[2][3]

It is grown as an ornamental tree, often planted in temple grounds in Japan.
It is also often grown as bonsai.[2]
