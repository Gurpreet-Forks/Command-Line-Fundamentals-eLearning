## Distribution[edit]

The plant is native to the mountains of Central Asia in northern Pakistan,
northeastern Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, eastern Kazakhstan, western
China, western Mongolia, and south-central Russia.

It typically grows at altitudes of 2,000-4,100 metres (6,600-13,500 ft).[2][3]

## Description[edit]

Juniperus pseudosabina is variable in shape, growing as a shrub or small tree,
reaching 1-10 metres (3.3-32.8 ft) tall. The leaves are of two forms, juvenile
needle-like leaves 4-8 mm long, and adult scale-leaves 1.3-2 mm long on shoots
1.5-2 mm thick. Juvenile leaves are found mainly on seedlings but mature
plants continue to bear some juvenile leaves as well as adult, particularly on
shoots damaged by browsing.

It is largely dioecious with separate male and female plants, but some
individual plants produce both sexes. The cones are berry-like, 8-14 mm long
and 7-10 mm diameter, blue-black with a whitish waxy bloom, and contain a
single seed; they are mature in about 18 months. The male cones are 2-3 mm
long, and shed their pollen in late winter.[2][3]

Conservation

Although it has a wide distribution and is not currently threatened, increased
grazing by domestic livestock in the region could threaten it in the
future.[3]
