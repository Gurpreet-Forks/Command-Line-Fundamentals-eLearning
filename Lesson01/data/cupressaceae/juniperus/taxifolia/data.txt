Juniperus taxifolia (Bonin Islands juniper; Japanese: ???? Shimamuro) is a
species of juniper, endemic to the Bonin Islands southeast of Japan.[2][3][4]

It is an evergreen coniferous shrub growing to a height of 1-3 m (rarely a
small tree to 13 m tall). The leaves are needle-like, in whorls of three,
light green, 7-14 mm long and 1-1.5 mm broad, with a double white stomatal
band (split by a green midrib) on the inner surface. It is dioecious, with
separate male and female plants. The seed cones are berry-like, green ripening
in 18 months to reddish-brown with a variable light waxy coating; they are
spherical, 8-10 mm diameter, and have six or nine fused scales in two or three
whorls of three; the three larger scales each with a single seed. The seeds
are dispersed when birds eat the cones, digesting the fleshy scales and
passing the hard seeds in their droppings. The pollen cones are yellow, 5 mm
long.[2][3]

Some authors include Juniperus lutchuensis from the Ryukyu Islands in J.
taxifolia as a synonym,[3] or variety,[5] while others treat it as a distinct
species as it has a distinct DNA profile.[2]

Its conservation status, previously given as Data Deficient,[6] is now listed
as Vulnerable.[4]
