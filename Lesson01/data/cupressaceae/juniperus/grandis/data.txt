## Distribution[edit]

The tree is native to the Sierra Nevada in eastern California and western
Nevada; and the White and Inyo Mountains, San Gabriel and San Bernardino
Mountains, and higher elevations of Mojave Desert mountains, in Southern
California.[1][3]

It is found in exposed, dry, rocky slopes, flats, pinyon-juniper woodland, and
Temperate coniferous forest habitats, including the Sierra Nevada upper
montane forest and Sierra Nevada subalpine zone ecoregions. It grows at
elevations of 100-3,100 metres (330-10,170 ft).[1]

## Description[edit]

Juniperus grandis is a medium-sized tree 12-26 metres (39-85 ft) tall. It has
a stout trunk up to 3 metres (9.8 ft) diameter, with red-brown bark.[1]

The whorled leaves are scale-like and closely appressed. Most plants are
dioecious, but about 5-10% are monoecious.[1]

Its fleshy and berry-like cones are 5-9 mm diameter.[1] Its pollination period
is May and June.[3] The seeds are wingless.
