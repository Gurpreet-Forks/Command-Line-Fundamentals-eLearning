Juniperus excelsa, commonly called the Greek juniper, is a juniper found
throughout the eastern Mediterranean, from northeastern Greece and southern
Bulgaria across Turkey to Syria and Lebanon, and the Caucasus mountains.

A subspecies, J. excelsa subsp. polycarpos, known as the Persian juniper,
occurs in the Alborz and other mountains of Iran east to northwestern
Pakistan, and an isolated population in the Jebal Akhdar mountains of Oman;
some botanists treat this as a distinct species, J. macropoda.

## Description[edit]

Juniperus excelsa is a large shrub or tree reaching 6-20 metres (20-66 ft)
tall (rarely 25 metres (82 ft)). It has a trunk up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) in
diameter, and a broadly conical to rounded or irregular crown. The leaves are
of two forms, juvenile needle-like leaves 8-10 mm long on seedlings, and adult
scale-leaves 0.6-3 mm long on older plants.

It is largely dioecious with separate male and female plants, but some
individual plants produce both sexes. The cones are berry-like, 6-11 mm in
diameter, blue-black with a whitish waxy bloom, and contain 3-6 seeds; they
are mature in about 18 months. The male cones are 3-4 mm long, and shed their
pollen in early spring.

It often occurs together with Juniperus foetidissima, being distinguished from
it by its slenderer shoots 0.7-1.3 mm diameter (1.2-2 mm diameter in J.
foetidissima), and grey-green, rather than mid green, leaves.

The Algum wood mentioned in the Bible may be from this species, but is not
definitely so.
