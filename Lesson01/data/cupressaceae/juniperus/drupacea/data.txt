Juniperus drupacea

Juniperus drupacea, the Syrian juniper, is a species of juniper native to the
eastern Mediterranean region from southern Greece (Parnon Oros, Peloponnese),
southern Turkey, western Syria, and Lebanon, growing on rocky sites from
800-1700 m altitude.

## Description[edit]

Juniperus drupacea is the tallest species of juniper, forming a conical tree
10-25 m tall, exceptionally up to 40 m, and with a trunk up to 1-2 m thick. It
has needle-like leaves in whorls of three; the leaves are green, 5-25 mm long
and 2-3 mm broad, with a double white stomatal band (split by a green midrib)
on the inner surface. It is usually dioecious, with separate male and female
plants.

The seed cones are the largest of any juniper, berry-like but hard and dry,
green ripening in about 25 months to dark purple-brown with a pale blue waxy
coating; they are ovoid to spherical, 20-27 mm long and 20-25 mm diameter, and
have six or nine fused scales in 2-3 whorls, each scale with a slightly raised
apex. The three apical scales each bear a single seed, but with the three
seeds fused together into a single nut-like shell. The male cones are produced
in clusters (unlike any other juniper) of 5-20 cones together, yellow, 3-4 mm
long, and fall soon after shedding their pollen in early spring.

Because of its distinct cones with the seeds fused three together and the
clustered male cones, it has sometimes been treated in a distinct genus of its
own as Arceuthos drupacea (Labill.) Antoine & Kotschy, but genetic studies
have shown it is fairly closely related to Juniperus macrocarpa and Juniperus
oxycedrus.
