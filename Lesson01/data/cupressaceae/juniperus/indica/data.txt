Juniperus indica, the black juniper, is a juniper native to high-altitude
climates in the Himalaya, occurring from the northern Indus Valley in Kashmir
east to western Yunnan in China.

It is of interest as the highest elevation woody plant known, reported growing
as high as 5200 m in southern Tibet; the lowest limit being 2600 m.

It is a shrub growing to 50-200 cm tall, with largely horizontal branching.
The leaves are dark grey-green, dimorphic, with adult plants having mostly
scale-like leaves 1-3 mm long, while young plants have mostly needle-like
leaves 5-8 mm long, but needle-like leaves can also be found on shaded shoots
of adult plants. The leaves are borne in whorls of three on strong stout main
stem shoots, and opposite pairs on thinner, slower-growing shoots. It is
dioecious, with male (pollen) and female (seed) cones on separate plants. The
mature seed cones are ovoid, berry-like, 6-10 mm long, glossy black, and
contain a single seed; the seeds are dispersed by birds which eat the cones,
digest the fleshy cone pulp, and excrete the seeds in their droppings.
