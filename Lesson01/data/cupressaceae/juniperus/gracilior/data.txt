Juniperus gracilior is a species of conifer in the cypress family,
Cupressaceae. It is endemic to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, where there
are localized populations in both Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its
Spanish-language common names are sabina and cedre.[1]

There are three varieties of this species. All three are rare. They grow in
humid forest habitat alongside palms and ferns.[1]

The typical variety is known only from a locality near Constanza, Valle del
Jaque; var. ekmanii is recorded from Morne la Selle and Morne la Visite,
although the latter subpopulation is now thought to be extinct; and var.
urbaniana appears to have been reduced to inaccessible areas although viable
populations were recorded in 1984 in Pic la Selle.
