## Description[edit]

Juniperus semiglobosa is an evergreen coniferous shrub or small to medium-
sized tree growing to 5-15 metres (16-49 ft) (rarely 20 metres (66 ft)) tall,
with a trunk up to 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) (rarely to 2-6 metres (6.6-19.7 ft))
diameter with flaky bark. The leaves are of two forms, juvenile needle-like
leaves 3-7 mm long on seedlings and occasionally (regrowth after browsing
damage) on adult plants, and adult scale-leaves 1-2 mm long on older plants;
they are arranged in decussate opposite pairs or whorls of three.

The cones are flattened globose (from which the name semiglobosa) to bi-lobed
or triangular, berry-like, 4-6 mm long and 4-8 mm across, blue-black, and
contain two or three seeds; they are mature in about 18 months. The pollen
cones are 3-5 mm long, and shed their pollen in spring. It is usually
dioecious (male and female cones on separate plants), but occasionally
monoecious (male and female cones on the same plant).[2][3][4]

### Varieties[edit]

A variety Juniperus semiglobosa var. talassica has been described from
Kyrgyzstan as having sweeter cone pulp, but does not differ from the type in
genetics or leaf chemistry, and is not usually regarded as distinct.[2][3]
