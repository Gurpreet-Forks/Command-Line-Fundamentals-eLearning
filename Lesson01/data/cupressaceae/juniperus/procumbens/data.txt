Juniperus procumbens is a low-growing shrubby juniper native to the southern
Japan. Its status as a wild plant is disputed; some authorities treat it as
endemic on high mountains on Kyushu and a few other islands off southern
Japan,[2] while others consider it native to the coasts of southern Japan
(north to Chiba Prefecture) and also the southern and western coasts of
Korea.[3] It is closely related to Juniperus chinensis, and is sometimes
treated as a variety of it, as J. chinensis var. procumbens.[2][3]

It is a prostrate shrub, usually growing 20-30 cm (7.9-11.8 in) tall,
occasionally 50 cm (20 in); while it does not get very tall it can get quite
wide, 2-4 m (6.6-13.1 ft) across or more, with long prostrate branches. The
branches tend to intertwine and form a dense mat. The leaves are arranged in
decussate whorls of three; all the leaves are juvenile form, needle-like, 6-8
mm long and 1-1.5 mm broad, with two white stomatal bands on the inner face.
It is dioecious with separate male and female plants. The cones are berry-
like, globose, 8-9 mm in diameter, dark blackish-brown with a pale blue-white
waxy bloom, and contain two or three seeds (rarely one); they are mature in
about 18 months. The male cones are 3-4 mm long, and shed their pollen in
early spring. It is dioecious, producing cones of only one sex on each
plant.[2][3][4]

## Cultivation and uses[edit]

A bonsai specimen of 'Nana'

Several cultivars have been selected, the most widely grown being 'Nana', a
slow-growing procumbent plant,[3][5] which in the UK has gained the Royal
Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[6][7] Others include 'Bonin
Isles', a strong-growing mat-forming plant collected on the Bonin Islands,[5]
and 'Green Mound', which may just be a renaming of 'Nana'.[5] A variegated
plant sold under the name J. procumbens 'Variegata' is actually a cultivar of
J. chinensis misnamed.[5]
