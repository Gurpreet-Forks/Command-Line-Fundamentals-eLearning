## Range[edit]

Taiwania cryptomerioides in the botanical magazine Shokubutsugaku zasshi
(1907)

Taiwania cryptomerioides' needle-like leaves.

The genus was formerly placed in the segregate family Taxodiaceae, it is now
included in the monotypic subfamily Taiwanioideae of the family Cupressaceae.
It is native to eastern Asia, growing in the mountains of central Taiwan, and
locally in southwest China (Guizhou, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Tibet) and
adjoining Myanmar, and northern Vietnam.[2][3] It is endangered by illegal
logging for its valuable wood in many areas. It is very likely that the range
was more extensive in the past before extensive felling for the wood.[1] The
populations in mainland Asia were treated as a distinct species Taiwania
flousiana by some botanists, but the cited differences between these and the
Taiwanese population are not consistent when a number of specimens from each
area are compared.

## Morphology[edit]

It is one of the largest tree species in Asia, reported to heights of up to 90
m (300 ft) tall and with a trunk up to 4 m (13 ft) diameter above buttressed
base.[4] The leaves are needle-like or awl-like and 8-15 mm (0.31-0.59 in)
long on young trees up to about 100 years old, then gradually becoming more
scale-like, 3-7 mm (0.12-0.28 in) long, on mature trees. The cones are small,
15-25 mm (0.59-0.98 in) long, with about 15-30 thin, fragile scales, each
scale with two seeds.

## History[edit]

The genus is named after the island of Taiwan, from where it first became
known to the botanical community in 1910.

The wood is soft, but durable and attractively spicy scented, and was in very
high demand in the past, particularly for temple building and coffins. The
rarity of the tree and its slow growth in plantations means legal supplies are
now very scarce; the species has legal protection in China and Taiwan.

Taiwania is also a journal that is published by National Taiwan University.
