Actinostrobus arenarius is a species of conifer in the cypress family,
Cupressaceae. Its common names include sandplain cypress,[3][4] Bruce
cypress,[1] Bruce cypress-pine, and tamin.[5] It is endemic to Western
Australia.[1]

This species is a shrub or a tree growing up to 5 metres (16 ft) tall. It has
spreading branches with small branchlets. The scale-like, gray-green leaves
are up to 1.2 centimetres (0.47 in) long and grow in threes. The cylindrical
male cones are up to half a centimeter long. The female cones are up to 2 cm
(0.79 in) long with pointed scales. They contain winged seeds.[5]

Western Australian State Botanist Charles Gardner described the species in
1964, from a specimen collected at Tammin, Western Australia.[5] The species
name is derived from the Latin word arena "sand", relating to where the
sandplain cypress grows.[6] A 2010 study of the genera Actinostrobus and
Callitris found that all three species of Actinostrobus lay within the current
concept of Callitris based on analysis of 42 morphological and anatomical
characters, hence Actinostrobus arenarius was renamed Callitris arenaria.[7]

This plant grows in colonies on sandplains, as part of a low scrubby plant
community known as kwongan; associated plant species include proteaceae of the
genus Banksia , Conospermum, Grevillea and Hakea, myrtaceae of the genus
Melaleuca, various Acacia species and the conifers Callitris preissii and C.
roei.[6] Some of its habitat has been degraded or destroyed, but the plant is
still widespread and grows in several protected areas.[1] It is found from
Lake Grace north to the Murchison River.[6]

The Bruce cypress colonises disturbed areas, forming stands on road verges and
areas cleared for agriculture.[6]
