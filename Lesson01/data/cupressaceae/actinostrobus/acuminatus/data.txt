Actinostrobus acuminatus, commonly known as dwarf cypress, creeping pine or
Moore cypress pine,[3] is a species of coniferous tree in the Cupressaceae
(cypress family). Like the other species in the genus Actinostrobus, it is
endemic to southwestern Western Australia, where it can be found along the
shorelines of rivers. The Mount Henry Peninsula is an example of the
environment in which this cypress is found. It shares the common name dwarf
cypress with several other plants, and shares the name creeping pine with
others.

It is a shrub or small tree, reaching 1-4.5 m tall. The leaves are evergreen
and mixed scale-like and needle-like, except on young seedlings, where they
are all needle-like. The leaves are arranged in six rows along the twigs, in
alternating whorls of three; the scale leaves are 2-4 mm long, the needle
leaves 10-20 mm long. The male cones are small, 3-6 mm long, and are located
at the tips of the twigs. The female cones start out similarly inconspicuous,
but mature in 18-20 months to 15-20 mm long, with a pointed apex.
