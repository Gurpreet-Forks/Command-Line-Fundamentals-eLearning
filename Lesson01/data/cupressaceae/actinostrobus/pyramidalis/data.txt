Actinostrobus pyramidalis, commonly known as swamp cypress, Swan River cypress
and King George's cypress pine,[3] is a species of coniferous tree in the
Cupressaceae (cypress family). Like the other species in the genus
Actinostrobus, it is endemic to southwestern Western Australia.

Swamp cypress is a shrub or small tree, reaching eight metres tall. The leaves
are evergreen and scale-like, except on young seedlings, where they are
needle-like. The leaves are arranged in six rows along the twigs, in
alternating whorls of three. The male cones are small, 3-6 mm long, and are
located at the tips of the twigs. The female cones start out similarly
inconspicuous, but mature in 18-20 months to 1-2 cm with a rounded apex.

The cones open and release the seeds only upon drying. They tend to remain
closed on the trees for many years, opening only if the branch, or the whole
tree, dies. Bushfire kills swamp cypress, but it also causes a great many
seeds to be released all at once, resulting in prolific regeneration. In one
case, an isolated tree on Jeegarnyeejip Island was killed by fire, and the
following winter there were 800 seedlings per square metre within a couple of
metres of the original specimen, and about 150 per square metre ten metres
away.

The species was first collected from Perth in September 1841 by Johann Preiss,
and a description was published by Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel in 1845 as
Actinostrobus pyramidalis. A 2010 study of the genera Actinostrobus and
Callitris found that all three species of Actinostrobus lay within the current
concept of Callitris based on analysis of 42 morphological and anatomical
characters, hence Actinostrobus pyramidalis was renamed Callitris
pyramidalis.[4]
