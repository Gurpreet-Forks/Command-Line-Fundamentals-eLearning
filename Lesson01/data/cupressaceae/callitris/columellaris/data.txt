Callitris columellaris is a species of coniferous tree in the family
Cupressaceae (cypress family), native to most of Australia. Common names
include White Cypress-pine, Murray River Cypress-pine, and Northern Cypress-
pine. Callitris columellaris has been naturalised in Hawaii[2] and in southern
Florida.[3][4][5]

It is a small evergreen tree, 4-12 m (rarely to 20 m) high, with a trunk up to
50 cm diameter. The leaves are scale-like, 2-6 mm long and 0.5 mm broad,
arranged in decussate whorls of three on very slender shoots 0.7-1 mm
diameter. The cones are globose, 1-2 cm diameter, with six triangular scales,
which open at maturity to release the seeds.

Some authors (e.g. Thompson & Johnson 1986, followed by the Flora of Australia
Online) divide it into three species (or occasionally as varieties), based
largely on the foliage colour, with green plants predominating on the east
coast of Australia, and glaucous plants in the interior, and on cone size,
with on average marginally smaller cones in tropical areas (north of 22?S).
However, others (e.g. Blake 1959, Farjon 2005) point out that both the foliage
colour and cone size is very variable, even from tree to tree in local
populations, and maintain that it is impossible to distinguish three taxa
within the species. When split into three species, the following names apply:

  * Callitris columellaris F.Muell. sensu stricto - coastal northeast New South Wales, southeast Queensland.
  * Callitris glaucophylla Joy Thomps. & L.A.S.Johnson (syn. C. columellaris var. campestris Silba; C. glauca nom. inval.; C. hugelii nom. inval.) - throughout most of the southern half of Australia.
  * Callitris intratropica R.T.Baker & H.G.Smith (syn. C. columellaris var. intratropica Silba) - northern Queensland, northern Northern Territory, northern Western Australia.

  * C. columellaris bark 

  * C. columellaris foliage
