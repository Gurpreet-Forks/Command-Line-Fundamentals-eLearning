Callitris macleayana is a species of conifer in the family Cupressaceae,
endemic to Australia.[2][3] The tree is commonly known as stringybark pine, as
well as brush cypress pine and Port Macquarie pine, although it does not
belong to the pine genus or family.[1] Stringybark pine is found in two
regions of Australia's East coast, one in the centre and one in the North.

## Description[edit]

Callitris macleayana is a large, straight-trunked tree with spreading branches
and up to 40 metres in height.[4] The bark is furrowed, and its juvenile
leaves are around 1 centimetre in length, giving way to mature foliage of 2-3
millimetres; cones often occur in solitary on larger fruiting branches, and
have 6 scales when borne on mature trees.[4]

## Distribution and habitat[edit]

Stringybark pine occurs over much of the central and Northeast coast of
Australia with an estimated range of 20,000 km2, although its range is divided
in two with a 1500 km gap between the two occurrences. In the North, it is
found in open forests upon humid highlands, mainly among Eucalyptus,
Syncarpia, and Corymbia species; in the South, it is found in wet sclerophyll
forests and occasionally in pockets of subtropical rainforest, the latter
including Ficus and Podocarpus species.[1] Within these habitats the
stringybark pine prefers exposed locations such as slopes and ridge tops,
whilst generally being found in poorer soils.[1] The tree's limitation to
humid sites is in contrast to many other species in the genus, such as
Callitris glaucophylla and Callitris endlicheri. The species has a cold
hardiness of -1.1 ?C to +4.4 ?C, corresponding to hardiness Zone 10.[5]
