Callitris roei, or Roe's cypress-pine, is a species of Callitris native to
Australia, where it is endemic to southwestern Western Australia from Moora
south to Albany and east to Cape Arid National Park.[2]

It is an evergreen shrub or small tree growing to 5 m tall. The leaves are
borne in decussate whorls of three, scale-like, 2-5 mm long and 1-1.5 mm
broad; leaves on seedlings are longer and needle-like, not scale-like. The
seed cones are globose, 1-2 cm diameter, with six scales in two whorls of
three; they mature in about 18 months from pollination. The pollen cones are
cylindrical, 3-6 mm long and 1.2-2 mm broad.[2]
