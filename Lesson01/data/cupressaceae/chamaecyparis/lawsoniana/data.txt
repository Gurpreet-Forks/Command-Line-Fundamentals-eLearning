Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, known as Port Orford cedar[2] or Lawson cypress,[3]
is a species of conifer in the genus Chamaecyparis, family Cupressaceae. It is
native to Oregon and northwestern California, and grows from sea level up to
1,500 m (4,900 ft) in the valleys of the Klamath Mountains, often along
streams.

## Description[edit]

It is a large evergreen tree, maturing up to 197 ft (60 m) tall or more, with
trunks 4-7 ft (1.2-2 m) in diameter, with feathery foliage in flat sprays,
usually somewhat glaucous (i.e. blue-green) in color. The leaves are scale-
like, 1/8-3/16 inch (3-5 mm) long, with narrow white markings on the
underside, and produced on somewhat flattened shoots. The foliage gives off a
rather pungent scent, not unlike parsley. The seed cones are globose,
9/32-9/16 inch (7-14 mm) diameter, with 6-10 scales, green at first, maturing
brown in early fall, 6-8 months after pollination. The male cones are 1/8-5/32
inch (3-4 mm) long, dark red, turning brown after pollen release in early
spring. The bark is reddish-brown, and fibrous to scaly in vertical strips.

## History and names[edit]

It was first discovered (by Euro-Americans) near Port Orford in Oregon and
introduced into cultivation in 1854, by collectors working for Charles Lawson
FRSE[4] of the Lawson & Son nursery in Edinburgh, Scotland, after whom it was
named as Lawson Cypress by the describing botanist Andrew Murray. The USDA
officially calls it by the name Port Orford cedar,[5] as do most people in its
native area, but some botanists prefer to use the name Lawson cypress (or in
very rare instances Port Orford cypress) instead. The name "Lawson's cypress"
is widely used in horticulture.

## Prehistory[edit]

The extinct Eocene species Chamaecyparis eureka, known from fossils found on
Axel Heiberg Island in Canada, is noted to be very similar to Chamaecyparis
pisifera and C. lawsoniana.[6]

## Wood[edit]

The wood is light yet has great strength and rot resistance, and is
particularly highly valued in east Asia, with large amounts being exported to
Japan where it is in high demand for making coffins, and for shrines and
temples.[7] Its lumber is also known for its highly fragrant ginger aroma. Due
to the straightness of its grain, it is also one of the preferred woods for
the manufacture of arrow shafts. It is also considered an acceptable, though
not ideal, wood for construction of aircraft.[8]

However, it is considered more than acceptable for use in stringed
instruments. Its fine grain, good strength and tonal quality are highly
regarded for soundboards in guitar making.[9]

## Cultivation[edit]

Chamaecyparis lawsoniana thrives best in well-drained but moist soils, in a
fairly sheltered position in full sun.Several hundred named cultivars of
varying crown shape, growth rates and foliage colour have been selected for
planting in parks and gardens. In the UK the following have gained the Royal
Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017):-[10]

## Disease[edit]

In the wild, the species is seriously threatened by a root disease caused by
the introduced oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora lateralis. This disease is also
a problem for horticultural plantings in some parts of North America. The tree
is sometimes killed, though less often, by other species of Phytophthora.

Phytophthora lateralis infection begins when mycelium, from a germinated
spore, invade the roots. The infection then spreads through the inner bark and
cambium around the base of the tree. Spread up the trunk is generally limited.
Infected tissue dies and effectively girdles the tree. Large trees are more
likely to be infected than small trees due to larger root areas (although all
trees at the edges of infected streams will eventually succumb). However,
large trees can often live with the infections for a longer duration (up to
several years).

C. lawsoniana in streamside populations are highly susceptible to Phytophthora
lateralis infection. However, the rate of Phytophthora spread through
populations in dry upland areas appears to be slow. Phytophthora lateralis
spreads through water via mobile spores (zoospores). The fungus also produces
resting spores (chlamydospores) that can persist in soil for a long period of
time. New infections generally begin when soil is transferred from an infected
population to a non-infected population via human or animal movement. After
initial infection in streamside populations, secondary spread via zoospores
quickly infects all downstream individuals.

Human facilitated spread is thought to be responsible for most new, and all
long-distance, infections. Soil on vehicle tires, especially logging trucks
and other off road vehicles, is considered the most pressing problem due to
the volume of soil that can be carried and the traffic rate in and between
susceptible areas. Spread on boots and mountain bike tires has also been
suggested and probably contributes to new infections locally.[35] Animal
facilitated spread is thought to occur, but is localized.

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and United States Forest Service (USFS)
attempt to prevent Phytophthora spread through road closures, monitoring,
research and education. Research has focused on determining the dynamics and
mechanisms of spread, as well as attempts to breed resistant trees. One
solution against Phytophtera is known generically as Mancozeb and also
commercially known as Dithane (C). Commercial preparations of the parasitic
fungus Pythium oligandrum are licensed for pest control, and documented to
predate many species of Phytophthora.[36]
