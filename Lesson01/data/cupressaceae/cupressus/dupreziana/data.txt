Cupressus dupreziana, the Saharan cypress, Moroccan cypress,[1] or tarout, is
a very rare coniferous tree native to the Tassili n'Ajjer mountains in the
central Sahara desert, southeast Algeria, where it forms a unique population
of trees hundreds of kilometres from any other trees. There are only 233
specimens of this critically endangered species, the largest about 22 m tall.
The majority are estimated to be over 2000 years old, with very little
regeneration due to the increasing desertification of the Sahara. Rainfall
totals in the area are estimated to be about 30 mm annually. The largest one
is named Tin-Balalan is believed to be the oldest tarout tree with a
circumference of 12 meters or 36 feet.

This species is distinct from the allied Cupressus sempervirens (Mediterranean
cypress) in its much bluer foliage with a white resin spot on each leaf, the
smaller shoots often being flattened in a single plane. It also has smaller
cones, only 1.5-2.5 cm long. Cupressus atlantica (Moroccan cypress) is more
similar, and is treated as a variety of the Saharan cypress (C. dupreziana
var. atlantica) by some authors.

Probably as a result of its isolation and low population, the Saharan cypress
has evolved a unique reproductive system of male apomixis whereby the seeds
develop entirely from the genetic content of the pollen. There is no genetic
input from the female "parent", which only provides nutritional sustenance
(Pichot et al., 2000). The Moroccan cypress does not share this
characteristic.

The Saharan cypress is occasionally cultivated in southern and western Europe,
in part for ex situ genetic conservation, but also as an ornamental tree.

An international arboretum is being established in Canberra, Australian
Capital Territory (ACT), Australia within which will be established forests of
rare and endangered species from throughout the world. One of these forests is
dedicated to Cupressus dupreziana and 1300 of the trees have been propagated
for planting in late 2007.
