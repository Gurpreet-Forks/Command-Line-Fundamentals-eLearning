Fokienia is a genus of conifer tree belonging to the cypress family. In its
characteristics, Fokienia is intermediate between the genera of Chamaecyparis
and Calocedrus. Genetically Fokienia is much closer to Chamaecyparis, and not
all researchers recognize Fokienia as a separate genus.[2] The genus comprises
only one living species, Fokienia hodginsii or Fujian cypress (Chinese: ???;
pinyin: Fujianbai; Vietnamese: Pomu), and one fossil species (Fokienia
ravenscragensis).[3][4]

Fokienia hodginsii is native from southeastern China (provinces of Zhejiang,
Guizhou, Yunnan and Fujian) to Northern Vietnam (provinces of Ha Bac, Ha
Giang, Ha Tinh, Hoa Binh, Son La, Nghe An, Lao Cai, Lai Chau, Thanh Hoa, Tuyen
Quang, Yen Bai and Vinh Phu), west central Vietnam (provinces of Dak Lak, Gia
Lai, Lam Dong), and west to northern Laos. The name derives from the old
Romanised name of Fujian province, China, from where the first specimen was
introduced to Europe, collected by Captain Hodgins in 1908.[3] [4]

Fokienia hodginsii

Fokienia is an evergreen tree, 25-30 m tall. It has greyish-brownish bark that
peels off when the tree is young. On older trees, the bark presents
longitudinal fissures and becomes aromatic. The leaves are arranged in
flattened branchlet systems, with the branchlets in one plane. The leaves on
adult trees are in opposite decussate pairs, the alternating pairs not evenly
spaced so appearing as whorls of 4 at the same level; they are sub-acute,
about 2-5 mm long, glossy green above, and with white stomatal bands below.
The lateral leaves are ovate and compressed, and facial leaves are
oblanceolate with a triangular apex. On young trees, the leaves are larger, up
to 8-10 mm long and 6 mm broad.[3]

[4]

The male cones are oval or cylindrical, around 2.5 mm long, terminal on the
shoots. They have from 3 to 5 pairs of scales. The female cones are much
larger, 15-25 mm long and 14-22 mm broad, globose or sub-globose, and ripen in
the second year. They have 5-8 pairs of scales. There are two winged seeds on
each scale. They are around 4 mm long, angular and pointed. On the upper and
lower surfaces there are 2 large resin blisters. The wings are lateral and
very unequal.[3] [4]

The tree does not tolerate shade, and requires mild climate and abundant
rainfall to grow best. It occurs mainly on humid soil in montane habitats. In
Vietnam, it grows on limestone or granite terrain above 900 m altitude.

The fossil species Fokienia ravenscragensis was described from the early
Paleocene (66-60 m.a. before present) Ravenscrag formation of southwest
Saskatchewan and adjacent Alberta, Canada.

## Uses[edit]

The wood is very much like that of other cedars in cypress family with a fine,
straight grain and distinct aroma. Laotian and Dao tribesmen use Fujian
cypress timber for wall partitioning or roofing. The timber was formerly used
for coffins and is occasionally referred to as "coffinwood". In Vietnam, it is
considered a precious timber because of its characteristic aroma and its
exceptional density; therefore it is used to make art works, pieces of
furniture, and charcoal of high heat value. It is considered an ecologically
threatened species in Vietnam.

Distillation, especially of its root, gives an essential oil called pemou oil
used in aromatherapy.[5]
