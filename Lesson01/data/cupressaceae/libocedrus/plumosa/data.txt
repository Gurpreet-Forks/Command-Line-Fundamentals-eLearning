## Distribution[edit]

The tree is native to the North Island; and locally at the north end of the
South Island, near Nelson (41? S).

It grows from sea level up to 600 metres (2,000 ft) in altitude, in temperate
rainforests.

It is an IUCN Red List Near threatened species, that is endangered by habitat
loss.[2][3]

## Description[edit]

Young 'kawaka' tree.

Libocedrus plumosa is an evergreen coniferous tree growing to 30-35 metres
(98-115 ft) tall, with a trunk up to 3 metres (9.8 ft) diameter.

The foliage is arranged in flattened sprays; the leaves are scale-like,
arranged in opposite decussate pairs on the shoots; the facial leaves are 1-2
mm long and 1 mm broad, and the lateral leaves distinctly larger, 2-5 mm long
and 1.5-2 mm broad.

The seed cones are cylindrical, 12-18 mm long, with four scales each with a
prominent curved spine-like bract; they are arranged in two opposite decussate
pairs around a small central columella; the outer pair of scales is small and
sterile, the inner pair large, each bearing two winged seeds. They are mature
about six to eight months after pollination. The pollen cones are 3-5 mm
long.[2]

## Cultivation[edit]

The kawaka has been planted as an ornamental tree in several parts of the
British Isles, including as far north as Castlewellan, Northern Ireland.[4]
