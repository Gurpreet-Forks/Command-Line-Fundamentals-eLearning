Libocedrus austrocaledonica is a species of Libocedrus, endemic to New
Caledonia, occurring mainly in the southern half of the island (also one site
in the northern half), at 750-1,400 m altitude in montane cloud forest
scrub.[1][2]

It is an evergreen coniferous shrub (rarely a small tree) growing to 2-6 m
tall, often multi-stemmed, with trunks up to 10 cm diameter. The foliage is
arranged in strongly flattened sprays; the leaves are scale-like, arranged in
opposite decussate pairs on the shoots; the facial leaves are 1-2 mm long and
1 mm broad, and the lateral leaves markedly larger, 3-7 mm long and 1.5-3 mm
broad. The seed cones are cylindrical, 10-12 mm long, with four scales each
with a prominent curved spine-like bract; they are arranged in two opposite
decussate pairs around a small central columella; the outer pair of scales is
small and sterile, the inner pair large, each bearing two winged seeds. They
are mature about six to eight months after pollination. The pollen cones are
5-8 mm long.[2]
