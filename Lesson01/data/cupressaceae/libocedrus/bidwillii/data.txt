Libocedrus bidwillii variously called pahautea, kaikawaka or New Zealand
cedar[2] is a species of Libocedrus, endemic to New Zealand on both the North
and South Islands; on the North Island, it occurs from Te Aroha southward. It
grows at 250-1,200 m altitude in temperate rainforests.[3][4]

It is an evergreen coniferous tree growing to 25 m tall, with a trunk up to
1.5 m diameter. The foliage is arranged in flattened sprays; the leaves are
scale-like, 1.5-2 mm long and 1 mm broad, arranged in opposite decussate pairs
on the shoots. The seed cones are cylindrical, 8-12 mm long, with four scales
each with a prominent curved spine-like bract; they are arranged in two
opposite decussate pairs around a small central columella; the outer pair of
scales is small and sterile, the inner pair large, bearing two winged seeds.
They are mature about six to eight months after pollination. The pollen cones
are 2.5-5 mm long.[3] The timber seldom becomes commercially available. It is
very light in weight and a distinct light purple when cut. The timber in small
dimension sizes is prone to spiral and twist when cut. It is sometimes used
for lightweight sailing boat construction. It glues and holds ring nails well.
