Taxus canadensis, the Canada yew[2] or Canadian yew, is a conifer native to
central and eastern North America, thriving in swampy woods, ravines,
riverbanks and on lake shores. Locally called simply "yew", this species is
also referred to as American yew or ground-hemlock.

Most of its range is well north of the Ohio River. It is, however, found as a
rare ice age relict in some coves of the Appalachian Mountains. The
southernmost colonies are known from Ashe and Watauga Counties in North
Carolina.[4]

It is usually a sprawling shrub, rarely exceeding 2.5 m tall. It sometimes
forms strong upright central leaders, but these cannot be formed from
spreading branches, only from the original leader of the seedling plant. The
shrub has thin scaly brown bark. The leaves (needles) are lanceolate, flat,
dark green, 1-2.5 cm (3/8-1 inch) long and 1-2.4 mm (0.039-0.094 inches)
broad,[3] arranged in two flat rows either side of the branch.

The seed cones are highly modified, each cone containing a single seed partly
surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red berry-
like structure called an aril, open at the end. The seeds are eaten by
thrushes, waxwings and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in
their droppings. The male cones are globose, 3 mm diameter. It is a monoecious
plant - one of the few in the genus.

## Uses and traditions[edit]

All parts of Canadian yew, save the aril, are toxic; it is, however, thought
to be of lower toxicity than T. baccata.[citation needed]

Tribes in its native range used small quantities of yew leaf tea topically or
internally for a variety of ailments - notably rheumatism. Tribes are also
been said to have used yew twigs in steam baths to help alleviate rheumatism.
Again, the plant is quite toxic and modern herbalists prefer safer, more
effective herbs.

Taxus canadensis is also being harvested in northern Ontario, Quebec and
Atlantic Canada as the plant is a source of the class of poisonous chemicals
known as taxanes, which have been a focus for cancer research.[5] T.
canadensis is much more abundant than the near-threatened Taxus brevifolia
(Pacific yew), and the "greens" (new growth) can be harvested sustainably
every five years, instead of stripping the bark and killing the plant.

The most abundant taxane in T. canadensis is 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III,
which can be effectively converted to 10-deacetylbaccatin III, used in the
production of paclitaxel.[6] Two additional taxanes have been identified from
T. canadensis, including
7?,10?,13?-triacetoxy-5?-(3'-dimethylamino-3'-phenylpropanoyl)oxy-2?-hydroxy-2(3->20)abeotaxa-4(20),11-dien-9-one
and
2?,10?-diacetoxy-9?-hydroxy-5?-(3'-dimethylamino-3'-phenylpropanoyl)oxy-3,11-cyclotax-4(20)-en-13-one.[7]
