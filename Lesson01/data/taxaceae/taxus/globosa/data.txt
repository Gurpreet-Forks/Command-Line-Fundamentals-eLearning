Taxus globosa, the Mexican yew, is an evergreen shrub and one of the eight
species of yew. The Mexican yew is a rare species, only known to be found in a
small number of locations in eastern Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and
Honduras,[2] and is listed as an endangered species. The Mexican yew is a
shrub that grows to an average height of 4.6m. It has large, sharp light green
needles growing in ranks on either side of its branches.

There are several projects in order to produce Paclitaxel (an anti-tumor
agent) around the world, but Mexican yew has not been as well studied because
its low production of Taxol (Bringi et al., 1995) [3] by in vitro plant cell
cultures. Few researchers focus their work on this species, the team leader on
Taxus globosa S. is perhaps that of Barradas[4] at Veracruz Institute of
Technology (Instituto Tecnologico de Veracruz).
