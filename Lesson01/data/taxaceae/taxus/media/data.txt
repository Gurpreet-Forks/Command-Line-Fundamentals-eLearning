Taxus x media  
Two immature Taxus media (Anglojap) var. hicksii yews planted in central
Indiana, United States of America. Although T. media are slow-growing, the
specimen on the right may require pruning within 2-3 years in order to avoid
blocking the nearby sidewalk.

Taxus x media, more commonly known as the Anglojap yew[1] or simply Taxus
media, is a conifer (more specifically, a yew) created by the hybridization of
yew species Taxus baccata and Taxus cuspidata. This hybridization was thought
to have been performed by the Massachusetts-based horticulturalist T.D.
Hatfield in the early 1900s.[2]

## Taxonomy and common naming[edit]

The Taxus media ("Anglojap") yew is a hybrid between Taxus baccata and Taxus
cuspidata. The common name Anglojap is a portmanteau stemming from the
national origin of T. baccata (a species native to England) and the national
origin of T. cuspidata (a species native to Japan).[1]

## Description[edit]

Like most yew species, T. media prefers well-drained and well-watered soils,
but has some degree of drought tolerance and in fact may die in conditions of
excessive precipitation if the soil beneath the plant is not sufficiently
well-drained.[1]

Taxus media is among the smallest extant species in the genus Taxus and
(depending upon cultivar) may not even grow to the size of what one would
consider a typical tree. Immature shrubs are very small and achieve (over the
time span of ten to twenty years) heights of at most 20 feet and diameters of
at most 8 feet, depending on the cultivar.[2] Furthermore, T. media is known
to grow rather slowly and is not injured by frequent pruning, making this
hybrid a very desirable as a hedge in low-maintenance landscaping and also a
good candidate for bonsai.[1]

## Toxicity[edit]

Taxus media also shares with its fellow yew trees a high level of taxine in
its branches, needles, and seeds. Taxine is toxic to the mammalian heart.[3]

## Varieties (Cultivars)[edit]

  * Taxus media var. hicksii (also known by the common name Hicks's yew or alternately, Hicks yew) is a common cultivar of this hybrid, and is the tallest and thinnest variety of T. media, limiting itself to a 4 foot (1.3 meter) diameter despite the fact it can achieve a height of close to 20 feet.[2][4]
  * Another commonly-planted cultivar of T. Media is the broader-spreading densiformis version, which can reach a diameter exceeding 10 feet; nonetheless, this cultivar does not grow much past 5 feet in height.[2]
