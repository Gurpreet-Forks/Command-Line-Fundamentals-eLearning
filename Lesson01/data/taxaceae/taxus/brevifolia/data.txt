Taxus brevifolia, the Pacific yew[4] or western yew, is a conifer native to
the Pacific Northwest of North America. It ranges from southernmost Alaska
south to central California, mostly in the Pacific Coast Ranges, but with
isolated disjunct populations in southeast British Columbia (most notably
occurring on Zuckerberg Island near Castlegar) and in north to central
Idaho.[5][6][7][8][9][10]

## Characteristics[edit]

The Pacific yew is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, growing 10-15 m
tall and with a trunk up to 50 cm diameter, rarely more. In some instances,
trees with heights in excess of 20 m occur in parks and other protected areas,
quite often in gullies. The tree is extremely slow growing, and has a habit of
rotting from the inside, creating hollow forms. This makes it difficult and
sometimes impossible to make accurate rings counts to determine a specimen's
true age. Often damaged by succession of the forest, it usually ends up in a
squat, multiple leader form.

It has thin scaly brown bark, covering a thin layer of off-white sap wood with
a darker heartwood that varies in color from brown to a magenta/purplish hue
to deep red. The leaves are lanceolate, flat, dark green, 1-3 cm long and 2-3
mm broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to
align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem except on erect
leading shoots where the spiral arrangement is more obvious.

The seed cones are highly modified, each cone containing a single seed 4-7 mm
long partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright
red berry-like structure called an aril, 8-15 mm long and wide and open at the
end. The arils are mature 6-9 months after pollination. The seeds contained in
the arils are eaten by thrushes and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds
undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2-3
months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The male cones
are globose, 3-6 mm diameter, and shed their pollen in early spring. It is
mostly dioecious, but occasional individuals can be variably monoecious, or
change sex with time.[citation needed]

## Habitat[edit]

Pacific yew grows in varying types of environments; however, in drier
environments it is mostly limited to stream side habitats, whereas in moist
environments it will grow up onto slopes and ridgetops.[5] Pacific yew is
shade tolerant; however it can also grow in sun.[11] The tree's shade
tolerance allows it to form an understory, which means that it can grow along
streams providing shade to maintain water temperature.[12]

## Varieties of Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia)[edit]

Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta. Although T. brevifolia is typically a tree as
described above, T. brevifolia var. reptaneta is a shrub variety that
generally occurs in the mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety,
3,500 to 4,000 ft (1000-1219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the Klamath
Mountains region, and at lower elevations further north.[13] It is
distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. brevifolia) by its
stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before
ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off to one side of the
stem, usually the upper side.[14] The epithet reptaneta is from the Latin
reptans which means "creeping, prostrate, and rooting,"[15] which is exactly
what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet
reptaneta (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name,
thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on
open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory. It
also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the
thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground.[13]
This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the
upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one
with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise
from the upper surface.

Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta has been arbitrarily indicated synonymous with
typical yew, T. brevifolia (var. brevifolia); there are no studies to support
this view. Even though the two varieties may be genetically distinct, some
botanists recognize species or varieties only if they have different
geographically ranges. For example, T. mairei var. speciosa, which occurs with
the typical variety in southern China in 10 of 13 provinces, was rejected
because "there is no geographic reason" for recognizing it[16] even though it
appears genetically distinct.[17]

Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta has also been proposed to be elevated to
subspecies status without justification or explanation. Such a change would
likely cause considerable confusion in view of the subspecies rank having
already been used in the genus Taxus for defining geographically separated
subspecies of a single species (T. baccata).[18] Further, it has been
recommended that taxonomists be strongly discouraged from "elevating a
'variety' to a 'subspecies' unless there is sufficient scientific evidence to
warrant such an elevation," and that "it is crucial to provide
continuity."[19]

Taxus brevifolia var. polychaeta. Typical Taxus brevifolia, like most species
in the genus, usually produces a single ovule on a complex scaly shoot,
composed of a primary shoot and a secondary short shoot. To the casual
observer they appear as one funnelform shoot with an ovule at the apex.[20]
However, Taxus brevifolia var. polychaeta differs from var. brevifolia in
producing a relatively longer primary shoot[13] with as many five secondary
shoots.[21] The epithet, polychaeta, is in reference to the primary shoot
resembling a polychaete worm; hence, its common name "worm cone yew." Variety
polychaeta appears to be relatively rare. It may have been extirpated from the
type locality--around Mud Bay near Olympia, Washington--as a result of urban
expansion. It is also known from northern Idaho and Sonoma County,
California.[13][22]

As in the case with thicket yew, worm yew has been indicated to be the same as
the typical variety, but again there are no specific studies to support this
conclusion. The authority of thicket yew and worm cone yew has been involved
in the study of the genus Taxus for 25 years at the time the varieties were
described.[13][23]

## Uses[edit]

Traditionally, the wood was used by Native Americans to make bows and paddles
for canoes, in addition many other items from daily life.[24] The Japanese
have also used the wood for decorative purposes.[5]

Members of the Pit River Tribe would sell this plant to the Ukiah.[25]

The Concow tribe calls the tree yol'-ko (Konkow language)[26]

### Discovery of taxol[edit]

The chemotherapy drug paclitaxel (taxol), used in breast, ovarian, and lung
cancer treatment, is derived from Taxus brevifolia. As it was already becoming
scarce when its chemotherapeutic potential was realized, the Pacific yew was
never commercially harvested from its habitat at a large scale; the widespread
use of the paclitaxel (taxol) was enabled when a semi-synthetic pathway was
developed from extracts of cultivated yews of other species. Unlicensed
pharmaceutical production use of closely related wild yew species in India and
China may be threatening some of those species.[27]
