## Distribution[edit]

Known from two to three locations in Arunachal Pradesh in India: Turoo Hills
(Das et al., 2008) the Delei valley and a valley in the Dafla Hills (Gajurel
et al., 2006). Its presence in adjoining areas of China have not been
confirmed. Known subpopulations are small and localised. Declines have been
observed in one location.

## Habitat and ecology[edit]

Occurs in warm temperate mountane rain forest on north-facing slopes at
altitudes between 1600 and 2000 metres above sea-level. These are 'mossy
forests' dominated by Quercus spp., Castanopsis spp., Acer spp. and
Rhododendron spp., with associated taxa such as Magnolia sp., Michelia sp.,
Corylopsis himalayana, Betula alnoides, Carpinus viminea and Exbucklandia
populnea.

## Human uses[edit]

Locally used for house construction (Gajurel et al., 2006).

## Conservation status[edit]

### Global status and rationale[edit]

Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii) There is an urgent need to establish forest
reserves as well as cultivation action to provide ex situ conservation for
this species Further surveys are required to establish its full distribution
and population size. Recent surveys (Gajurel et al., 2006; Das et al., 2008)
have observed that in some areas this species is threatened by forest
clearance associated with shifting agriculture ("jhuming"), localised
exploitation for timber and firewood, infrastructure developments (roads and
hydroelectric schemes).

### Conservation actions[edit]

There is an urgent need to establish forest reserves as well as cultivation
action to provide ex situ conservation for this species Further surveys are
required to establish its full distribution and population size.
