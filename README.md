# Command Line Fundamentals
The most basic interface to a computer - the command line - remains the most flexible and powerful way of performing and automating various day to day tasks and processing data. Command Line Fundamentals will teach all about how command lines work. You'll begin by exploring the basics and then focus on the most common tooling - namely the bash shell (which is standard on all Linux and iOS systems). Then, you'll explore the traditional UNIX command line programs as implemented by the GNU project. Next, you'll learn how to use redirection and pipelines to assemble these programs to solve complex problems. You'll also complete the course by exploring the basics of shell scripting that let you automate tasks.


## What you will learn
* Use the bash shell to run commands 
* Implement basic UNIX utilities such as cat, tr, sort, and uniq
* Use shell wildcards to manage a group of files
* Apply most useful keyboard shortcuts in the shell
* Use redirection and pipes to process data
* Write both basic and advanced shell scripts to automate tasks



### Hardware requirements
For an optimal experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: Intel Core i3 or equivalent
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM
* **Storage**: 1 GB available space



### Software requirements
You'll also need the following software installed in advance:
* **OS**: Any desktop Linux version or iOS, or Windows 10
* For Windows 10 systems - Windows subsystem for Linux (this is only available in the latest versions)
Access to installation instructions can be provided separately to course material for large training centers and organizations. All source code is publicly available on GitHub and fully referenced within the training material.
