 # Exercise 20: Chess game extractor - Handling Options 
 # Make sure you are in the ~/Lesson4 folder


 # Step 1 to 3 - Write script and save to pgn_extract3.sh
 # Before moving to the next step, remember to run the command chmod u+x on it to make it executable
 
 
 # Step 4
./pgn_extract3.sh -m
./pgn_extract3.sh -m 15
./pgn_extract3.sh -n
./pgn_extract3.sh -n 30
./pgn_extract3.sh -x

 # Step 5
./pgn_extract3.sh -m
./pgn_extract3.sh -m 10
./pgn_extract3.sh -n
./pgn_extract3.sh -n 10

 # Step 6 & 7 - Modify pgn_extract3.sh by adding the following and save as pgn_extract4.sh
 # Before moving to the next step, remember to run the command chmod u+x on it to make it executable
